*   Phase() is use to determine the phase of the game: opening, middlegame or  *
*   endgame.  the three phases are identified by the following criteria:       *
*                                                                              *
*   (a) opening:  if any minor pieces are still on their original squares, or  *
*       the king has not yet castled nor given up the right to castle, then    *
*       opening development rules still apply.                                 *
*   (b) middle-game:  if the opening criteria are not met, and the end-game    *
*       criteria are not met, then all that's left is a middle-game.           *
*   (c) end-game:  if both sides have less than 17 points of material, not     *
*       counting pawns, (Q=9, R=5, BN=3) then we are in an end-game.           *
*                                                                              *
