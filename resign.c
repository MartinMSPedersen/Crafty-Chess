 *   ResignOrDraw() is used to determine if the program should either resign   *
 *   or offer a draw.  this decision is based on two criteria:  (1) current    *
 *   search evaluation and (2) time remaining on opponent's clock.             *
 *                                                                             *
 *   the evaluation returned by the last search must be less than the resign   *
 *   threshold to trigger the resign code, or else must be exactly equal to the*
 *   draw score to trigger the draw code.                                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *   the opponent must have enough time to be able to win or draw the game if  *
 *   were played out as well.                                                  *
 *                                                                             *
