*   ResignOrDraw() is used to determine if the program should either resign    *
*   or offer a draw.  this decision is based on two criteria:  (1) current     *
*   search evaluation and (2) time remaining on opponent's clock.              *
*                                                                              *
*   the evaluation returned by the last search must be less than the resign    *
*   threshold to trigger the resign code, or else must be exactly equal to the *
*   draw score to trigger the draw code.                                       *
*                                                                              *
*   the opponent must have enough time to be able to win or draw the game if   *
*   were played out as well.                                                   *
*                                                                              *
