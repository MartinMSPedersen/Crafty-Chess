   The contents of this include file are the prototypes for the glue

   host program Crafty and the EPD Kit.  Therefore, this file may have
   to be changed (as will epdglue.c) if used with a different host program.

   The contents of the other source files in the EPD Kit (epddefs.h,
   epd.h, and epd.c) should not have to be changed for different hosts.
