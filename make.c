 *   MakeMove() is responsible for updating the position database whenever a   *
 *   piece is moved.  It performs the following operations:  (1) update the    *
 *   board structure itself by moving the piece and removing any captured      *
 *   piece.  (2) update the hash keys.  (3) update material counts.  (4) update*
 *   castling status.  (5) update number of moves since last reversible move.  *
 *                                                                             *
 *   There are some special-cases handled here, such as en passant captures    *
 *   where the enemy pawn is not on the <target> square, castling which moves  *
 *   both the king and rook, and then rook moves/captures which give up the    *
 *   castling right to that side when the rook is moved.                       *
 *                                                                             *
 *   note:  wtm = 1 if white is to move, 0 otherwise.  btm is the opposite and *
 *   is 1 if it is not white to move, 0 otherwise.                             *
 *                                                                             *

 *   First, some basic information is updated for all moves *
 *   before we do the piece-specific stuff.  We need to     *
 *   save the current position and both hash signatures,    *
 *   and add the current position to the repetition-list    *
 *   for the side on move, before the move is actually made *
 *   on the board.  We also update the 50 move rule         *
 *   counter, which will be reset if a capture or pawn move *
 *   is made here.                                          *
 *                                                          *
 *   If the en passant flag was set the previous ply, we    *
 *   have already used it to generate moves at this ply,    *
 *   and we need to clear it before continuing.  If it is   *
 *   set, we also need to update the hash signature since   *
 *   the EP opportunity no longer exists after making any   *
 *   move at this ply (one ply deeper than when a pawn was  *
 *   advanced two squares).                                 *
