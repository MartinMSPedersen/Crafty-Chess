 *   Iterate() is the routine used to drive the iterated search.  It           *
 *   repeatedly calls search, incrementing the search depth after each call,   *
 *   until either time is exhausted or the maximum set search depth is         *
 *   reached.                                                                  *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Crafty has several specialized modes that influence how moves are chosen  *
 *   and when.                                                                 *
 *                                                                             *
 *   (1) "mode tournament" is a special way of handling book moves.  Here we   *
 *   are dealing with pondering.  We play our move, and then we take all of    *
 *   the known book moves for the opponent (moves where we have an instant     *
 *   reply since they are in the book) and eliminate those from the set of     *
 *   root moves to search.  We do a short search to figure out which of those  *
 *   non-book moves is best, and then we ponder that move.  It will look like  *
 *   we are always out of book, but we are not.  We are just looking for one   *
 *   of two cases:  (i) The opponent's book runs out and he doesn't play the   *
 *   expected book line (which is normally a mistake), where this will give us *
 *   a good chance of pondering the move he will actually play (a non-book     *
 *   move) without sitting around and doing nothing until he takes us out of   *
 *   book;  (ii) Our book doesn't have a reasonable choice, so we do a search  *
 *   and ponder a better choice so again we are not wasting time.  The value   *
 *   of "mode" will be set to "tournament" to enable this.                     *
 *                                                                             *
 *   (2) "book random 0" tells the program to enumerate the list of known book *
 *   moves, but rather than playing one randomly, we do a shortened search and *
 *   use the normal move selection approach (which will, unfortunately, accept *
 *   many gambits that a normal book line would bypass as too risky.  But this *
 *   can also find a better book move in many positions, since many book lines *
 *   are not verified with computer searches.                                  *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Those modes are handled within Book() and Ponder() but they all use the   *
 *   same iterated search as is used for normal moves.                         *
 *                                                                             *
