 *   RepetitionCheck() is used to detect a draw by repetition.  The repetition *
 *   list is a 2d array indexed by wtm (0,1) and the repetition indices which  *
 *   are also indexed by wtm.  This keeps positions with wtm separate from the *
 *   positions where it is btm, so that we can easily check the positions for  *
 *   the right side on move without having to wade through the positions with  *
 *   the wrong side on move as well.  Positions are only added to this list in *
 *   MakeMove() which alsi increments the proper index.  UnmakeMove() then     *
 *   decrements the proper index when the move is retracted, effectively       *
 *   removing the position from the list.                                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *   RepetitionCheck() scans the list to determine if this position has        *
 *   occurred before.  If so, the position will be treated as a draw by        *
 *   Search().                                                                 *
 *                                                                             *
 *   RepetitionCheck() also handles 50-move draws.  The position[] structure   *
 *   countains the count of moves since the last capture or pawn push.  When   *
 *   this value reaches 100 (plies, which is 50 moves) the score is set to     *
 *   DRAW.                                                                     *

 *   irreversible move, there is no way to repeat a prior   *
