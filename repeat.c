 *   Repeat() is used to detect a draw by repetition.  The repetition list is  *
 *   a simple 1d array that contains the Zobrist signatures for each position  *
 *   reached in the game since the last irreversable moves at the root.  New   *
 *   positions are only added to this list here in Repeat().                   *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Repeat() scans the list to determine if this position has occurred at     *
 *   once previously (two-fold repetition.)  If so, this will be treated as a  *
 *   draw by Search()/Quiesce().                                               *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Repeat() also handles 50-move draws.  The position[] structure contains   *
 *   the count of moves since the last capture or pawn push.  When this value  *
 *   reaches 100 (plies, which is 50 moves) the score is set to DRAW.          *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Repeat() has one tricky issue.  MakeMoveRoot() has to insert moves into   *
 *   the repetition list so that things will work well.  We end up with the    *
 *   list having entries from 0 through "rep_index" where the last entry is    *
 *   the entry stored after the last actual move in the game.  Search() will   *
 *   call Repeat() at ply=1, which stores the SAME position at position        *
 *   rep_index + 1.  That gets the list out of sync.  To solve this, Iterate() *
 *   decrements rep_index immediately prior to calling Search(), and it then   *
 *   increments it immediately after Search() returns.  This causes Search()   *
 *   to overwrite the entry with the same value for ply=1, but now the list is *
 *   in a sane state for the rest of the search.  Do NOT remove those to lines *
 *   in Iterate() or repetition detection will be broken.                      *
 *                                                                             *
