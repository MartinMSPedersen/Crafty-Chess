 *   RepetitionCheck() is used to detect a draw by repetition.  it saves the   *
 *   current position in the repetition list each time it is called.  the list *
 *   contains all positions encountered since the last irreversible move       *
 *   (capture or pawn push).                                                   *
 *                                                                             *
 *   RepetitionCheck() then scans the list to determine if this position has   *
 *   occurred before.  if so, the position will be treated as a draw by        *
 *   Search().   note that for a repetition to happen in the first two plies   *
 *   of the tree, the position has to be repeated three times, while for plies *
 *   beyond two, two repetitions trigger a draw score.                         *
 *                                                                             *
 *   RepetitionCheck() also handles 50-move draws.  the position[] structure   *
 *   countains the count of moves since the last capture or pawn push.  when   *
 *   this value reaches 100 (plies, which is 50 moves) the score is set to     *
 *   DRAW.                                                                     *
 *                                                                             *
