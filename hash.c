 *   HashProbe() is used to retrieve entries from the transposition table so   *
 *   this sub-tree won't have to be searched again if we reach a position that *
 *   has been searched previously.  A transposition table position contains    *
 *   the following data packed into 128 bits with each item taking the number  *
 *   of bits given in the table below:                                         *
 *                                                                             *
 *     shr  bits     name description                                          *
 *      55   9       age  search id to identify old trans/ref entries.         *
 *      53   2      type  0->value is worthless; 1-> value represents a        *
 *                        fail-low bound; 2-> value represents a fail-high     *
 *                        bound; 3-> value is an exact score.                  *
 *      32  21      move  best move from the current position, according to    *
 *                        the search at the time this position was stored.     *
 *      17  15     draft  the depth of the search below this position, which   *
 *                        is used to see if we can use this entry at the       *
 *                        current position.                                    *
 *       0  17     value  unsigned integer value of this position + 65536.     *
 *                        this might be a good score or search bound.          *
 *       0  64       key  64 bit hash signature, used to verify that this      *
 *                        entry goes with the current board position.          *
 *                                                                             *
 *   The underlying scheme here is that we use a "bucket" of N entries.  In    *
 *   HashProbe() we simply compare against each of the four entries for a      *
 *   match.  Each "bucket" is carefully aligned to a 64-byte boundary so that  *
 *   the bucket fits into a single cache line for efficiency.  The bucket size *
 *   (N) is currently set to 4.                                                *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Crafty uses the lockless hashing approach to avoid lock overhead in the   *
 *   hash table accessing (reading or writing).  What we do is store the key   *
 *   and the information in two successive writes to memory.  But since there  *
 *   is nothing that prevents another CPU from interlacing its writes with     *
 *   ours, we want to make sure that the bound/draft/etc really goes with the  *
 *   key.  Consider thread 1 trying to store A1 and A2 in two successive 64    *
 *   words, while thread 2 is trying to store B1 and B2.  Since the two cpus   *
 *   are fully independent, we could end up with {A1,A2}, {A1,B2}, {B1,A2} or  *
 *   {B1,B2}.  The two cases with one word of entry A and one word of entry B  *
 *   are problematic since the information part does not belong with the       *
 *   signature part, and a hash hit (signature match) will retrieve data that  *
 *   does not match the position.  Let's assume that the first word is the     *
 *   signature (A1 or B1) and the second word is the data (A2 or B2).  What we *
 *   do is store A1^A2 (exclusive-or the two parts) in the 1 (key) slot of the *
 *   entry, and store A2 in the data part.  Now, before we try to compare the  *
 *   signatures, we have to "un-corrupt" the stored signature by again using   *
 *   xor, since A1^A2^A2 gives us the original A1 signature again.  But if we  *
 *   store A1^A2, and the data part gets replaced by B2, then we try to match  *
 *   against A1^A2^B2 and that won't match unless we are lucky and A2 == B2    *
 *   which means the match is OK anyway.  This eliminates the need to lock the *
 *   hash table while storing the two values, which would be a big performance *
 *   hit since hash entries are stored in almost every node of the tree.       *
 *                                                                             *

 *   HashStore() is used to store entries into the transposition table so that *
 *   this sub-tree won't have to be searched again if the same position is     *
 *   reached.  We basically store three types of entries:                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (1) EXACT.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is greater than alpha and less than     *
 *        beta, which is an exact score, which also has a best move to try if  *
 *        we encounter this position again.                                    *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (2) LOWER.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is greater than or equal to beta.  We   *
 *        know know that this score should be at least equal to beta and may   *
 *        well be even higher.  So this entry represents a lower bound on the  *
 *        score for this node, and we also have a good move to try since it    *
 *        caused the cutoff, although we do not know if it is the best move or *
 *        not since not all moves were search.                                 *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (3) UPPER.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is less than or equal to alpha.  We     *
 *        know know that this score should be at least equal to alpha and may  *
 *        well be even lower.  So this entry represents an upper bound on the  *
 *        score for this node.  We have no idea about which move is best in    *
 *        this position since they all failed low, so we store a best move of  *
 *        zero.                                                                *

 *   For storing, we may require two passes.  We make our first pass looking   *
 *   for the entry with the lowest draft (depth remaining) and which was from  *
 *   a previous search (old entry).  We choose the lowest draft old entry, if  *
 *   there is one, otherwise we make a second pass over the bucket and choose  *
 *   the entry with the shallowest draft, period.                              *
 *                                                                             *

 *     draft is greater than or equal the current remaining *
 *     depth, then we should never get here unless the      *
 *     stored bound or score is unusable because of the     *

 *     search (not iteration) then we choose the entry from *
 *     this set that has the smallest draft, since it is    *

 *     overwrite, we simply choose the entry from the       *
 *     bucket with the smallest draft and overwrite that.   *
