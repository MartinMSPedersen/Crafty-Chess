 *   HashProbe() is used to retrieve entries from the transposition table so   *
 *   this sub-tree won't have to be searched again if we reach a position that *
 *   has been searched previously.  A transposition table position contains    *
 *   the following data packed into 128 bits with each item taking the number  *
 *   of bits given in the table below:                                         *
 *                                                                             *

 *       0   3       age  search id to identify old trans/ref entries.         *
 *       3   2      type  0->value is worthless; 1-> value represents a        *
 *                        fail-low bound; 2-> value represents a fail-high     *
 *                        bound; 3-> value is an exact score.                  *
 *       5   6    unused  unused at present time.                              *
 *      11  21      move  best move from the current position, according to    *
 *                        the search at the time this position was stored.     *
 *      32  15     draft  the depth of the search below this position, which   *
 *                        is used to see if we can use this entry at the       *
 *                        current position.                                    *
 *      47  17     value  unsigned integer value of this position + 65536.     *
 *                        this might be a good score or search bound.          *
 *      64  64       key  64 bit hash signature, used to verify that this      *
 *                        entry goes with the current board position.          *
 *                                                                             *
 *   The underlying scheme here is that there are essentially two separate     *
 *   transposition/refutation (hash) tables that are interleaved into one      *
 *   large table.  We have a depth-priority table where the draft of an entry  *
 *   is used to decide whether to keep or overwrite that entry when a store    *
 *   is done.  We have a 2x larger always-store table where entries that       *
 *   either (a) don't have enough draft to be stored in the depth-priority     *
 *   table are stored or (b) entries overwritten in the depth-priority table   *
 *   get pushed into the always-store table to avoid losing them completely.   *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Each logical entry is a triplet, one depth-preferred entry and two        *
 *   always-store entries.  To choose which always-store entry to overwrite,   *
 *   we simply use the LSB of the hash signature that was not used in the      *
 *   initial table address computation.                                        *
 *                                                                             *

 *   HashStore() is used to store entries into the transposition table so that *

 *   reached.  We basically store three types of entries:                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (1) EXACT.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is greater than alpha and less than     *
 *        beta, which is an exact score, which also has a best move to try if  *
 *        we encounter this position again.                                    *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (2) LOWER.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is greater than or equal to beta.  We   *
 *        know know that this score should be at least equal to beta and may   *
 *        well be even higher.  So this entry represents a lower bound on the  *
 *        score for this node, and we also have a good move to try since it    *
 *        caused the cutoff, although we do not know if it is the best move or *
 *        not since not all moves were search.                                 *
 *                                                                             *
 *     (3) UPPER.  This entry is stored when we complete a search at some ply  *
 *        and end up with a score that is less than or equal to alpha.  We     *
 *        know know that this score should be at least equal to alpha and may  *
 *        well be even lower.  So this entry represents an upper bound on the  *
 *        score for this node.  We have no idea about which move is best in    *
 *        this position since they all failed low, so we store a best move of  *
 *        zero.                                                                *
