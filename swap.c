 *   Swap() is used to analyze capture moves to see whether or not they appear *
 *   to be profitable.  The basic algorithm is extremely fast since it uses the*
 *   bitmaps to determine which squares are attacking the [target] square.     *
 *                                                                             *
 *   The algorithm is quite simple.  Using the attack bitmaps, we enumerate all*
 *   the pieces that are attacking [target] for either side.  Then we simply   *
 *   use the lowest piece (value) for the correct side to capture on [target]. *
 *   we continually "flip" sides taking the lowest piece each time.            *
 *                                                                             *
 *   As a piece is used, if it is a sliding piece (pawn, bishop, rook or queen)*
 *   we remove the piece, then generate moves of bishop/queen or rook/queen    *
 *   and then add those in to the attackers, removing any attacks that have    *
 *   already been used.                                                        *
 *                                                                             *
