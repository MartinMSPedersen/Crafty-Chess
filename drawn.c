 *   Drawn() is used to answer the question "is this position a hopeless draw?"*
 *   Several considerations are included in making this decision, but the most *
 *   basic one is simply the remaining material for each side.  If either side *
 *   has pawns, it's not a draw.  With no pawns, equal material is a draw.     *
 *   Otherwise, the superior side must have enough material to be able to force*
 *   a mate.                                                                   *
