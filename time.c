 *   TimeCheck() is used to determine when the search should stop.  It uses    *
 *   several conditions to make this determination:  (1) The search time has   *
 *   exceeded the time per move limit;  (2) The value at the root of the tree  *
 *   has not dropped to low.  (3) If the root move was flagged as "easy" and   *
 *   no move has replaced it as best, the search can actually be stopped early *
 *   to save some time on the clock.  If (2) is false, then the time is        *
 *   extended based on how far the root value has dropped in an effort to      *
 *   avoid whatever is being lost.                                             *
 *                                                                             *
 *   We use one additional trick here to avoid stopping the search just before *
 *   we change to a better move.  Once we reach the time limit, we set do not  *
 *   immediately stop the search, rather, we let it continue to any/all root   *
 *   moves that are "in progress" complete.  This is important, particularly   *
 *   on a parallel search that splits at the root like Crafty does.  A new     *
 *   best move will take quite a bit of time to search, and with just one CPU  *
 *   working on it, we might not have time to complete it before the search    *
 *   time limit is reached.  Once we reach this point, we set a flag that      *
 *   says "do not start searching a new root move, but do not abort any active *
 *   search.  As processors finish their root moves, they will begin to help   *
 *   those with incomplete root move searches to make sure that none of them   *
 *   will become a new best move.  This way, once we start searching any root  *
 *   move, we will not give up on it until the search has completed and the    *
 *   move was proved worse than the best root move so far, or until we         *
 *   discover that this root move is actually better.                          *
 *                                                                             *
 *   This is implemented by having Search() call TimeCheck() passing it a      *
 *   value of zero (0) for the parameter abort.  TimeCheck() will only end the *
 *   search if we have exceeded the max time limit or we have not gotten a     *
 *   best score at the root on the current iteration and we have reached the   *
 *   normal time limit.  Otherwise TimeCheck() will return the "abort" value   *
 *   which is always zero when called from Search().  We also call TimeCheck() *
 *   from NextRootMove() and it passes TimeCheck() a value of 1 for the abort  *
 *   flag.  Once anyone posts the "abort" flag, NextRootMove() will return a   *
 *   indication saying "no more root moves to search", which will eventually   *
 *   end the search when all current root moves are completed and              *
 *   NextRootMove() is called to obtain another root move to search.           *
 *                                                                             *
 *   The global variable "time_abort" is initially set to zero, and so long    *
 *   as it is zero, NextRootMove() will continue to return moves to search     *
 *   until the iteration ends.  Whenever the time_abort flag becomes non-zero, *
 *   NextRootMove() refuses to search any new moves, but the current searches  *
 *   are allowed to continue until they all complete or the hard time limit    *
 *   (absolute_time_limit) is reached where the search is terminated           *
 *   immediately to avoid overstepping the time control limits.                *
