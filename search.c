 *   Search() is the recursive routine used to implement the alpha/beta        *
 *   negamax search (similar to minimax but simpler to code.)  Search() is     *
 *   called whenever there is "depth" remaining so that all moves are subject  *
 *   to searching.  Search() recursively calls itself so long as there is at   *
 *   least one ply of depth left, otherwise it calls Quiesce() instead.        *
 *                                                                             *

 *   1. HashProbe() returns "HASH_HIT".  This terminates    *
 *   the search instantly and we simply return the value    *
 *   found in the hash table.  This value is simply the     *
 *   value we found when we did a real search in this       *
 *   position previously, and HashProbe() verifies that the *
 *   value is useful based on draft and current bounds.     *

 *   the hashed score/bound was no good, but it indicated   *
 *   that trying a null-move in this position would be a    *
 *   waste of time since it will likely fail low, not high. *
 *                                                          *

 *   do a normal search to resolve this node.               *
 *                                                          *

 *   Now it's time to try a probe into the endgame table-   *
 *   base files.  This is done if we notice that there are  *
 *   6 or fewer pieces left on the board.  EGTB_use tells   *
 *   us how many pieces to probe on.  Note that this can be *
 *   zero when trying to swindle the opponent, so that no   *
 *   probes are done since we know it is a draw.            *
 *                                                          *
 *   Note that in "swindle mode" this can be turned off by  *
 *   Iterate() setting "EGTB_use = 0" so that we won't      *
 *   probe the EGTBs since we are searching only the root   *
 *   moves that lead to a draw and we want to play the move *
 *   that makes the draw more difficult to reach by the     *
 *   opponent to give him a chance to make a mistake.       *
 *                                                          *
 *   Another special case is that we slightly fudge the     *
 *   score for draws.  In a normal circumstance, draw=0.00  *
 *   since it is "equal".  However, here we add 0.01 if     *
 *   white has more material, or subtract 0.01 if black has *
 *   more material, since in a drawn KRP vs KR we would     *
 *   prefer to have the KRP side since the opponent can     *
 *   make a mistake and convert the draw to a loss.         *

 *  searched to a shallower depth than normal (usually 3    *
 *  plies less but settable by the operator.) This will     *
 *  result in a cutoff if our position is very good, but it *
 *  produces the cutoff much quicker since the search is    *

 *  1.  The side on move is in check.  The null move        *
 *      results in an illegal position.                     *
 *  2.  No more than one null move can appear in succession *
 *      as all this does is burn 6 plies of depth.          *
 *  3.  The side on move has only pawns left, which makes   *
 *      zugzwang positions more likely.                     *
 *  4.  The transposition table probe found an entry that   *
 *      indicates that a null-move search will not fail     *
 *      high, so we avoid the wasted effort.                *

 *   Now for the forward-pruning stuff.  The idea here is   *
 *   based on the old FUTILITY idea, where if the current   *
 *   material + a fudge factor is lower than alpha, then    *
 *   there is little promise in searching this move to make *
 *   up for the material deficit.                           *
 *                                                          *
 *   This is a useful idea in today's 20+ ply searches, as  *
 *   when we near the tips, if we are too far behind in     *
 *   material, there is little time left to recover it and  *
 *   moves that don't bring us closer to a reasonable       *
 *   material balance can safely be skipped.  It is much    *
 *   more dangerous in shallow searches.                    *
 *                                                          *
 *   We have an array of pruning margin values that are     *
 *   indexed by depth (remaining plies left until we drop   *
 *   into the quiescence search) and which increase with    *
 *   depth since more depth means a greater chance of       *
 *   bringing the score back up to alpha or beyond.  If the *
 *   current material + the bonus is less than alpha, we    *
 *   simply avoid searching this move at all, and skip to   *
 *   the next move without expending any more effort.  Note *
 *   that this is classic forward-pruning and can certainly *
 *   introduce errors into the search.  However, cluster    *
 *   testing has shown that this improves play in real      *
 *   games.  The current implementation only prunes in the  *
 *   last 4 plies before quiescence, although this can be   *
 *   tuned with the "eval" command changing the "pruning    *
 *   depth" value to something other than 5 (test is for    *
 *   depth < pruning depth, current value is 5 which prunes *
 *   in last 4 plies only).  Testing shows no benefit in    *
 *   larger values than 5, although this might change in    *
 *   future versions as other things are modified.          *

 *   by an extension or a reduction.  If we get to this     *
 *   point, then the move is not being pruned.  So off we   *
 *   go to a recursive search/quiescence call to work our   *
 *   way toward a terminal node.                            *
 *                                                          *
 *   There are a couple of special-cases to handle.  If the *
 *   depth was reduced, and Search() returns a value >=     *
 *   beta, accepting that is risky (we reduced the move as  *
 *   we thought it was bad and expected it to fail low) so  *
 *   we repeat the search using the original (non-reduced)  *
 *   depth to see if the fail-high happens again.           *
 *                                                          *
 *   The other special-case is a result of the PVS idea and *
 *   is again a result of a fail-high.  Since we often      *
 *   narrow the window in PVS, if we narrow it at this ply  *
 *   and get a fail-high, we have to open it back up and    *
 *   repeat the search to see if it really fails high.  In  *
 *   most searches this is not done since we almost always  *
 *   reach this point with alpha = beta-1 so that there is  *
 *   no widening required.                                  *

 *   Now for the forward-pruning stuff.  The idea here is   *
 *   based on the old FUTILITY idea, where if the current   *
 *   material + a fudge factor is lower than alpha, then    *
 *   there is little promise in searching this move to make *
 *   up for the material deficit.                           *
 *                                                          *
 *   This is a useful idea in today's 20+ ply searches, as  *
 *   when we near the tips, if we are too far behind in     *
 *   material, there is little time left to recover it and  *
 *   moves that don't bring us closer to a reasonable       *
 *   material balance can safely be skipped.  It is much    *
 *   more dangerous in shallow searches.                    *
 *                                                          *
 *   We have an array of pruning margin values that are     *
 *   indexed by depth (remaining plies left until we drop   *
 *   into the quiescence search) and which increase with    *
 *   depth since more depth means a greater chance of       *
 *   bringing the score back up to alpha or beyond.  If the *
 *   current material + the bonus is less than alpha, we    *
 *   simply avoid searching this move at all, and skip to   *
 *   the next move without expending any more effort.  Note *
 *   that this is classic forward-pruning and can certainly *
 *   introduce errors into the search.  However, cluster    *
 *   testing has shown that this improves play in real      *
 *   games.  The current implementation only prunes in the  *
 *   last 4 plies before quiescence, although this can be   *
 *   tuned with the "eval" command changing the "pruning    *
 *   depth" value to something other than 5 (test is for    *
 *   depth < pruning depth, current value is 5 which prunes *
 *   in last 4 plies only).  Testing shows no benefit in    *
 *   larger values than 5, although this might change in    *
 *   future versions as other things are modified.          *

 *     We do not prune if we are safely pushing a passed    *

 *   We have determined whether the depth is to be changed  *
 *   by an extension or a reduction.  If we get to this     *
 *   point, then the move is not being pruned.  So off we   *
 *   go to a recursive search/quiescence call to work our   *
 *   way toward a terminal node.                            *
 *                                                          *
 *   There are a couple of special-cases to handle.  If the *
 *   depth was reduced, and Search() returns a value >=     *
 *   beta, accepting that is risky (we reduced the move as  *
 *   we thought it was bad and expected it to fail low) so  *
 *   we repeat the search using the original (non-reduced)  *
 *   depth to see if the fail-high happens again.           *
 *                                                          *
 *   The other special-case is a result of the PVS idea and *
 *   is again a result of a fail-high.  Since we often      *
 *   narrow the window in PVS, if we narrow it at this ply  *
 *   and get a fail-high, we have to open it back up and    *
 *   repeat the search to see if it really fails high.  In  *
 *   most searches this is not done since we almost always  *
 *   reach this point with alpha = beta-1 so that there is  *
 *   no widening required.                                  *
