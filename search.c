 *   Search() is the recursive routine used to implement the alpha/beta        *
 *   negamax search (similar to minimax but simpler to code.)  Search() is     *
 *   called whenever there is "depth" remaining so that all moves are subject  *
 *   to searching.  Search() recursively calls itself so long as there is at   *
 *   least one ply of depth left, otherwise it calls QuiesceChecks() instead.  *
 *                                                                             *

 *   produce a cutoff, or get nothing more than a good move *
 *   to try first.  There are four cases to handle:         *
 *                                                          *
 *   1. HashProbe() returns "EXACT" if this score is        *
 *   greater than beta, return beta.  Otherwise, return the *
 *   score.  In either case, no further searching is needed *
 *   from this position.  Note that lookup verified that    *
 *   the table position has sufficient "draft" to meet the  *
 *   requirements of the current search depth remaining.    *
 *                                                          *
 *   2. HashProbe() returns "UPPER" which means that when   *
 *   this position was searched previously, every move was  *
 *   "refuted" by one of its descendents.  As a result,     *
 *   when the search was completed, we returned alpha at    *
 *   that point.  We simply return alpha here as well.      *
 *                                                          *
 *   3. HashProbe() returns "LOWER" which means that when   *
 *   we encountered this position before, we searched one   *
 *   branch (probably) which promptly refuted the move at   *
 *   the previous ply.                                      *
 *                                                          *
 *   4. HashProbe() returns "AVOID_NULL_MOVE" which means   *
 *   the hashed score/bound was no good, but it indicated   *
 *   that trying a null-move in this position would be a    *
 *   waste of time since it will likely fail low, not high. *

 *  more way of getting out with minimal effort, where, we  *
 *  try a null move to see if we can get a quick  cutoff    *
 *  with only a little work.  this operates as follows.     *
 *  Instead of making a legal move, the side on move        *
 *  "passes" and does nothing.  The resulting position is   *
 *  searched to a shallower depth than normal (usually 3    *
 *  plies less but settable by the operator.) This will     *
 *  result in a cutoff if our position is very good, but it *
 *  produces the cutoff much quicker since the search is    *
 *  far shallower than a normal search that would also be   *
 *  likely to fail high.                                    *
 *                                                          *
 *  This is skipped for any of the following reasons:       *
 *                                                          *
 *  1.  The side on move is in check.  The null move        *
 *      results in an illegal position.                     *
 *  2.  No more than one null move can appear in succession *
 *      or else the search will degenerate into nothing.    *
 *  3.  The side on move has little material left making    *
 *      zugzwang positions more likely.                     *
 *  4.  The transposition table probe found an entry that   *
 *      indicates that a null-move search will not fail     *
 *      high, so we avoid the wasted effort.                *
 *  5.  If the alpha/beta window is non-null, this is a PV  *
 *      node where the null move should be avoided.         *

 *   SearchExtensions() is used to adjust the search depth for the tree below  *
 *   this node.  Checking moves are problematic as they sometimes lead to a    *
 *   deep win of material or a checkmate, or sometimes they are used to delay  *
 *   something (push it beyond the search horizon) so that it is not even      *
 *   found by the search.                                                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *   Additionally, the opposite is also true.  Some moves do not deserve as    *
 *   much effort as others, and we try to recognize that here and rather than  *
 *   extending the search depth (and effort) we actually reduce the search     *
 *   depth to save time that can be better spent on other moves.  Any move     *
 *   tactical in nature (captures, checks, passed pawn pushes, and so forth)   *
 *   are not reduced.  normal moves that appear to be "good" are also not      *
 *   reduced, including the hash table "best move", killer moves, and other    *
 *   such moves.  that leaves moves that have not been identified as good to   *
 *   be searched with reduced depth.
 *                                                                             *
 *   In reality, what we are doing is extending the obvious moves (checks) to  *
 *   search them deeper, reducing the moves that appear to be bad, to search   *
 *   those shallowly, and searching the normal-looking moves to the usual      *
 *   depth.                                                                    *

 *   The current move is not a check or we would have       *
 *   already extended it and exited.                        *
 *                                                          *
 *   Now it's time to try to reduce the search depth if the *
 *   move appears to be "poor".  To reduce the search, the  *
 *   following requirements must be met:                    *
 *                                                          *
 *   (1) We must be in the REMAINING_MOVES part of the move *
 *       ordering, so that we have nearly given up on       *
 *       failing high on any move.  This means that we have *
 *       tried all the "usual suspects" including the hash  *
 *       move, reasonable captures and finally killer       *
 *       moves.  Now we are left with a random collection   *
 *       of moves that are in no particular order and we    *
 *       don't really have any high expectation that we are *
 *       going to fail high on any of them, so we just      *
 *       plunge into the search to finish the node and move *
 *       on.                                                *
 *                                                          *
 *   (2) The remaining search depth left must satisfy the   *
 *       following inequality:                              *
 *                                                          *
 *         depth - 1 - LMR_depth <= LMR_min_depth           *
 *                                                          *
 *       Simply stated, for default settings, there must    *
 *       be at least 3 plies of depth left or we won't      *
 *       reduce since we are too close to the frontier and  *
 *       that leads to tactical mistakes.                   *
 *                                                          *
 *   (3) The current move must not be a checking move.      *
 *                                                          *
 *   (4) The side to move can not be in check;              *
 *                                                          *
 *   (5) The moving piece is not a passed pawn;             *
 *                                                          *
 *   (6) The current move can not affect the material       *
 *       balance, that is it can not be a capture or pawn   *
 *       promotion;                                         *
