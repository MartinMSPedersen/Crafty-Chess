|   produce a cutoff, or get nothing more than a good move |
|   to try first.  there are four cases to handle:         |
|                                                          |
|   1. HashProbe() returned "EXACT" if this score is       |
|   greater than beta, return beta.  otherwise, return the |
|   score.  In either case, no further searching is needed |
|   from this position.  note that lookup verified that    |
|   the table position has sufficient "draft" to meet the  |
|   requirements of the current search depth remaining.    |
|                                                          |
|   2. HashProbe() returned "UPPER" which means that       |
|   when this position was searched previously, every move |
|   was "refuted" by one of its descendents.  as a result, |
|   when the search was completed, we returned alpha at    |
|   that point.  we simply return alpha here as well.      |
|                                                          |
|   3. HashProbe() returned "LOWER" which means that       |
|   when we encountered this position before, we searched  |
|   one branch (probably) which promptly refuted the move  |
|   at the previous ply.                                   |
|                                                          |
|   4. HashProbe() returned "AVOID_NULL_MOVE" which means  |
|   the hashed score/bound was no good, but it indicated   |
|   that trying a null-move in this position will be a     |
|   waste of time.                                         |

|  first, we try a null move to see if we can get a quick  |
|  cutoff with only a little work.  this operates as       |
|  follows.  instead of making a legal move, the side on   |
|  move 'passes' and does nothing.  the resulting position |
|  is searched to a shallower depth than normal (usually   |
|  one ply less but settable by the operator) this should  |
|  result in a cutoff or at least should set the lower     |
|  bound better since anything should be better than not   |
|  doing anything.                                         |
|                                                          |
|  this is skipped for any of the following reasons:       |
|                                                          |
|  1.  the side on move is in check.  the null move        |
|      results in an illegal position.                     |
|  2.  no more than one null move can appear in succession |
|      or else the search will degenerate into nothing.    |
|  3.  the side on move has little material left making    |
|      zugzwang positions more likely.                     |
|                                                          |
|  the null-move search is also used to detect certain     |
|  types of threats.  the original idea of using the value |
|  returned by the null-move search was reported by C.     |
|  donninger, but was modified by Bruce Moreland (ferret)  |
|  in the following way:  if the null-move search returns  |
|  a score that says "mated in N" then this position is a  |
|  dangerous one, because not moving gets the side to move |
|  mated.  we extend the search one ply in this case, al-  |
|  though, as always, no more than one ply of extensions   |
|  are allowed at any one level in the tree.  note also    |
|  that this "threat" condition is hashed so that later,   |
|  if the hash table says "don't try the null move because |
|  it likely will fail low, we still know that this is a   |
|  threat position and should be extended.                 |
|                                                          |
