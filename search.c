 *   Search() is the recursive routine used to implement the alpha/beta        *
 *   negamax search (similar to minimax but simpler to code.)  Search() is     *
 *   called whenever there is "depth" remaining so that all moves are subject  *
 *   to searching.  Search() recursively calls itself so long as there is at   *
 *   least one ply of depth left, otherwise it calls QuiesceChecks() instead.  *

 *                                                          *
 *   1. HashProbe() returns "EXACT" if this score is        *
 *   greater than beta, return beta.  otherwise, return the *
 *   score.  In either case, no further searching is needed *
 *   from this position.  note that lookup verified that    *
 *   the table position has sufficient "draft" to meet the  *
 *   requirements of the current search depth remaining.    *
 *                                                          *
 *   2. HashProbe() returns "UPPER" which means that when   *
 *   this position was searched previously, every move was  *
 *   "refuted" by one of its descendents.  as a result,     *
 *   when the search was completed, we returned alpha at    *
 *   that point.  we simply return alpha here as well.      *
 *                                                          *
 *   3. HashProbe() returns "LOWER" which means that when   *
 *   we encountered this position before, we searched one   *
 *   branch (probably) which promptly refuted the move at   *
 *   the previous ply.                                      *
 *                                                          *
 *   4. HashProbe() returns "AVOID_NULL_MOVE" which means   *
 *   the hashed score/bound was no good, but it indicated   *
 *   that trying a null-move in this position would be a    *
 *   waste of time since it will likely fail low, not high. *

 *  first, we try a null move to see if we can get a quick  *
 *  cutoff with only a little work.  this operates as       *
 *  follows.  instead of making a legal move, the side on   *
 *  move 'passes' and does nothing.  the resulting position *
 *  is searched to a shallower depth than normal (usually   *
 *  3 plies less but settable by the operator) this will    *
 *  result in a cutoff if our position is very good, but it *
 *  produces the cutoff much quicker since the search is    *
 *  far shallower than a normal search that would also be   *
 *  likely to fail high.                                    *
 *                                                          *
 *  this is skipped for any of the following reasons:       *
 *                                                          *
 *  1.  the side on move is in check.  the null move        *
 *      results in an illegal position.                     *
 *  2.  no more than one null move can appear in succession *
 *      or else the search will degenerate into nothing.    *
 *  3.  the side on move has little material left making    *
 *      zugzwang positions more likely.                     *
 *  4.  the transposition table probe found an entry that   *
 *      indicates that a null-move search will not fail     *
 *      high, so we avoid the wasted effort.                *
 *  5.  if the alpha/beta window is non-null, this is a PV  *
 *      node where the null move should be avoided.         *
 *                                                          *
 *  the null-move search is also used to detect certain     *
 *  types of threats.  the original idea of using the value *
 *  returned by the null-move search was reported by C.     *
 *  Donninger, but was modified by Bruce Moreland (Ferret)  *
 *  in the following way:  if the null-move search returns  *
 *  a score that says "mated in 1" then this position is a  *
 *  dangerous one, because not moving gets the side to move *
 *  mated.  we extend the search in this case, although as  *
 *  always, no more than one ply of extensions is allowed   *
 *  at any one level in the tree.  note also that this      *
 *  "threat" condition is hashed so that later, if the hash *
 *  table says "don't try the null move because it likely   *
 *  will fail low, we still know that this is a threat      *
 *  position and that it should be extended.                *
 *                                                          *

 *   SearchExtensions() is used to adjust the search depth for the tree below  *
 *   this node.  checking moves are problematic as they sometimes lead to a    *
 *   deep win of material or a checkmate, or sometimes they are used to delay  *
 *   something (push it beyond the search horizon) so that it is not even      *
 *   found by the search.                                                      *
 *                                                                             *
 *   additionally, the opposite is also true.  some moves do not deserve as    *
 *   much effort as others, and we try to recognize that here and rather than  *
 *   extending the search depth (and effort) we actually reduce the search     *
 *   depth to save time that can be better spent on other moves.  any move     *
 *   is tactical in nature (captures, checks, passed pawn pushes, and so       *
 *   forth) are not reduced.  normal moves that appear to be "good" are also   *
 *   not reduced, including the hash table "best move", killer moves, and      *
 *   other such moves.  that leaves moves that have not been identified as     *
 *   "good" to be searched with reduced depth.  the final criterion here is    *
 *   that the "history value" must lie below some threshold indicating that    *
 *   this move has never been very good in the current search.                 *
 *                                                                             *
 *   In reality, what we are doing is extending the obvious moves (checks) to  *
 *   search them deeper, reducing the moves that appear to be bad, leaving the *
 *   more normal-looking moves alone.                                          *
 *                                                                             *

 *                                                          *

 *       move ordering, so that we have nearly given up on  *
 *       failing high on any move.                          *
 *                                                          *
 *   (2) the remaining search depth left must satisfy the   *
 *       following inequality:                              *
 *                                                          *

 *       simply stated, for default settings, there must    *
 *       be at least 3 plies of depth left or we won't      *
 *       reduce since we are too close to the frontier and  *
 *       that leads to tactical mistakes.                   *
 *                                                          *
 *   (3) the current move must not be a checking move.      *
 *                                                          *

 *       balance, that is it can not be a capture or pawn   *
