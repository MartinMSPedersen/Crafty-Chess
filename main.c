*  Crafty is the "son" (direct descendent) of Cray Blitz.  it is designed     *
*  totally around the bit-board data structure for reasons of speed of ex-    *
*  ecution, ease of adding new knowledge, and a *significantly* cleaner       *
*  overall design.  it is written totally in ANSI C with some few UNIX system *
*  calls required for I/O, etc.                                               *
*                                                                             *
*  main() is the driver for the chess program.  its primary function is to    *
*  cycle between asking the user for a move and calling for a tree search     *
*  to produce a move for the program.  after accepting an input string from   *
*  the user, this string is first passed to Option() which checks to see if   *
*  it is a command to the program.  if Option() returns a non-zero result,    *
*  the input was a command and was executed, otherwise the input should be    *
*  passed to input() for conversion to the internal move format.              *
*                                                                             *
*  version  description                                                       *
*                                                                             *
*    1.0    first version of the bit-board program to play a legitimate game  *
*           even though significant features are missing:  transposition      *
*           table, sophisticated scoring, etc.                                *
*                                                                             *
*    1.1    added the minimal window search.  at each ply in the tree, the    *
*           first branch is searched with the normal alpha/beta window, while *
*           remaining nodes are searched with value/value+1 which was         *
*           returned from searching the first branch.  If such a search       *
*           returns the upper bound, this position is once again searched     *
*           with the normal window.                                           *
*                                                                             *
*    1.2    added the classic null-move search.  the program searches the     *
*           sub-tree below the null move (typically) one play shallower than  *
*           the normal search, saving a lot of time.                          *
*                                                                             *
*    1.3    added the transposition table support.  this also includes the    *
*           code in Iterate() necessary to propagate the principal variation  *
*           from one iteration to the next to improve move ordering.          *
*                                                                             *
*    1.4    modified the transposition table to use three tables, one for 64  *
*           bits of white entry, one for 64 bits of black entry, and one with *
*           the remaining 32 bits of white and black entry combined into one  *
*           64 bit word.  eliminated the "bit fields" since they seemed to be *
*           erratic on most compilers and made portability nearly impossible. *
*                                                                             *
*    1.5    pawn scoring added.  this required three additions to the code:   *
*           (1) InitializePawnMasks() which produces the necessary masks to   *
*           let us efficiently detect isolated, backward, passed, etc. pawns; *
*           (2) a pawn hash table to store recently computed pawn scores so   *
*           it won't be too expensive to do complex analysis;  (3) Evaluate() *
*           now evaluates pawns if the current pawn position is not in the    *
*           pawn hash table.                                                  *
*                                                                             *
*    1.6    piece scoring added, although it is not yet complete.  also, the  *
*           search now uses the familiar zero-width window search for all but *
*           the first move at the root, in order to reduce the size of the    *
*           tree to a nearly optimal size.  this means that a move that is    *
*           only one point better than the first move will "fail high" and    *
*           have to be re-searched a second time to get the true value.  if   *
*           the new best move is significantly better, it may have to be      *
*           searched a third time to increase the window enough to return the *
*           score.                                                            *
*                                                                             *
*    1.7    replaced the old "killer" move ordering heuristic with the newer  *
*           "history" ordering heuristic.   this version uses the 12-bit key  *
*           formed by <from><to> to index into the history table.             *
*                                                                             *
*    1.8    added pondering for both PC and UNIX-based machines.  also other  *
*           improvements include the old Cray Blitz algorithm that takes the  *
*           P.V. returned by the tree search, and "extends" it by looking up  *
*           positions in the transposition table, which improves move         *
*           ordering significantly.  repetitions are now handled correctly.   *
*                                                                             *
*    1.9    added an opening book with flags to control which moves are       *
*           selected for play.  the book maintenance code is stubbed directly *
*           into the program, so that no additional executables are needed.   *
*                                                                             *
*    1.10   added king safety + hashing (as done in the old Cray Blitz).      *
*           nothing novel other than the use of bit-masks to speed up some of *
*           the tests.                                                        *
*                                                                             *
*    1.11   additional evaluation knowledge plus log_file so that program     *
*           saves a record of the game statistics for later analysis.  added  *
*           the "annotate" command to make the program analyze a game or part *
*           of a game for testing/debugging.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*    1.12   added ICS (Internet Chess Server) support for Xboard support so   *
*           that Crafty can play on ICS in an automated manner.  added new    *
*           commands to be compatible with Xboard.  Crafty also has a new     *
*           command-line interface that allows options to be entered on the   *
*           command-line directly, ie:  "crafty alarm=off verbose=2" will     *
*           start the program, set the move alarm off, and set verbose to     *
*           2.  this allows an "alias" to easily customize the program.       *
*                                                                             *
*    1.13   added time-control logic to the program.  it now monitors how     *
*           much time both it and its opponent uses when thinking about a     *
*           move to make.  when pondering, it only times itself from the      *
*           point that a move is actually entered.                            *
*                                                                             *
*    1.14   added the piece/square tables to the program to move static       *
*           scoring to the root of the tree since it never changes (things    *
*           like centralization of pieces, etc.)  also some minor tuning of   *
*           numbers to bring positional score "swings" down some.             *
*                                                                             *
*    1.15   added edit so that positions can be altered (and so ICS games     *
*           can be resumed after they are adjourned).  also added a "force"   *
*           command to force the program to play a different move than the    *
*           search selected.  search timing allocation slightly altered to    *
*           improve ICS performance.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*    1.16   significant adjustments to evaluation weights to bring positional *
*           scores down to below a pawn for "normal" positions.  some small   *
*           "tweaks" to king safety as well to keep the king safer.           *
*                                                                             *
*    1.17   added "development" evaluation routine to encourage development   *
*           and castling before starting on any tactical "sorties."  also     *
*           repaired many "bugs" in evaluation routines.                      *
*                                                                             *
*    1.18   added the famous Cray Blitz "square of the king" passed pawn      *
*           evaluation routine.  this will evaluate positions where one       *
*           side has passed pawns and the other side has no pieces, to see    *
*           if the pawn can outrun the defending king and promote.  note that *
*           this is rediculously fast because it only requires one AND        *
*           to declare that a pawn can't be caught!                           *
*                                                                             *
*    2.0    initial version preparing for search extension additions.  this   *
*           version has a new "next_evasion()" routine that is called when    *
*           the king is in check.  it generates sensible (nearly all are      *
*           legal) moves which include capturing the checking piece (if there *
*           is only one), moving the king (but not along the checking ray),   *
*           and interpositions that block the checking ray (if there is only  *
*           one checking piece.                                               *
*                                                                             *
*    2.1    search is now broken down into three cleanly-defined phases:      *
*           (1) basic full-width search [Search()]; (2) extended tactical     *
*           search [extend()] which includes winning/even captures and then   *
*           passed pawn pushes to the 6th or 7th rank (if the pawn pushes     *
*           are safe);  (3) normal quiescence search [Quiesce()] which only   *
*           includes captures that appear to gain material.                   *
*                                                                             *
*    2.2    king safety code re-written and cleaned up.  Crafty was giving    *
*           multiple penalties which was causing the king safety score to be  *
*           extremely large (and unstable.)  now, if it finds something wrong *
*           with king safety, it only penalizes a weakness once.              *
*                                                                             *
*    2.3    king safety code modified further, penalties were significant     *
*           enough to cause search anomolies.  modified rook scoring to avoid *
*           having the rook trapped in the corner when the king is forced to  *
*           move rather than castle, and to keep the rook in a position to be *
*           able to reach open files in one move, which avoids getting them   *
*           into awkward positions where they become almost worthless.        *
*                                                                             *
*    2.4    king safety code completely rewritten.  it now analyzes "defects" *
*           in the king safety field and counts them as appropriate.  these   *
*           defects are then summed up and used as an index into a vector of  *
*           of values that turns them into a score in a non-linear fashion.   *
*           increasing defects quickly "ramp up" the score to about 1/3+ of   *
*           a pawn, then additional faults slowly increase the penalty.       *
*                                                                             *
*    2.5    first check extensions added.  in the extension search (stage     *
*           between full-width and captures-only, up to two checking moves    *
*           can be included, if there are checks in the full-width part of    *
*           the search.  if only one check occurs in the full-width, then     *
*           only one check will be included in the extension phase of the     *
*           selective search.                                                 *
*                                                                             *
*    2.6    evaluation modifications attempting to cure Crafty's frantic      *
*           effort to develop all its pieces without giving a lot of regard   *
*           to the resulting position until after the pieces are out.         *
*                                                                             *
*    2.7    new evaluation code to handle the "outside passed pawn" concept.  *
*           Crafty now understands that a passed pawn on the side away from   *
*           the rest of the pawns is a winning advantage due to decoying the  *
*           king away from the pawns to prevent the passer from promoting.    *
*           the advantage increases as material is removed from the board.    *
*                                                                             *
*    3.0    the 3.* series of versions will primarily be performance en-      *
*           hancements.  the first version (3.0) has a highly modified        *
*           version of MakeMove() that tries to do no unnecessary work.  it   *
*           is about 25% faster than old version of MakeMove() which makes    *
*           Crafty roughly 10% faster.  also calls to Mask() have been        *
*           replaced by constants (which are replaced by calls to Mask() on   *
*           the Crays for speed) to eliminate function calls.                 *
*                                                                             *
*    3.1    significantly modified king safety again, to better detect and    *
*           react to king-side attacks.  Crafty now uses the recursive null-  *
*           move search to depth-2 instead of depth-1, which results in       *
*           slightly improved speed.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*    3.2    null-move restored to depth-1.  depth-2 proved unsafe as Crafty   *
*           was overlooking tactical moves, particularly against itself,      *
*           which lost several "won" games.                                   *
*                                                                             *
*    3.3    additional king-safety work.  Crafty now uses the king-safety     *
*           evaluation routines to compare king safety for both sides.  if    *
*           one side is "in distress" pieces are attracted to that king in    *
*           "big hurry" to either attack or defend.                           *
*                                                                             *
*    3.4    "threat extensions" added.  simply, this is a null-move search    *
*           used to determine if a move is good only because it is a horizon  *
*           effect type move.  we do a null move search after a move fails    *
*           high anywhere in the tree.  the window is normally lowered by 1.5 *
*           pawns, the idea being that if the fail-high move happens in a     *
*           position that fails "really low" with a null move, then this move *
*           might be a horizon move.  to test this, re-search this move with  *
*           the depth increased by one.                                       *
*                                                                             *
*    3.5    50-move rule implemented.  a count of moves since the last pawn   *
*           move or capture is kept as part of the position[] structure.  it  *
*           is updated by MakeMove().  when this number reaches 100 (which    *
*           in plies is 50 moves) RepetitionCheck() will return the draw      *
*           score immediately, just as though the position was a repetition   *
*           draw.                                                             *
*                                                                             *
*    3.6    search extensions cleaned up to avoid excessive extensions which  *
*           produced some wild variations, but which was also slowing things  *
*           down excessively.                                                 *
*                                                                             *
*    3.7    endgame strategy added.  two specifics: KBN vs K has a piece/sq   *
*           table that will drive the losing king to the correct corner.  for *
*           positions with no pawns, scoring is altered to drive the losing   *
*           king to the edge and corner for mating purposes.                  *
*                                                                             *
*    3.8    hashing strategy modified.  Crafty now stores search value or     *
*           bound, *and* positional evaluation in the transposition table.    *
*           this avoids about 10-15% of the "long" evaluations during the     *
*           middlegame, and avoids >75% of them in endgames.                  *
*                                                                             *
*    4.0    evaluation units changed to "millipawns" where a pawn is now      *
*           1000 rather than the prior 100 units.  this provides more         *
*           "resolution" in the evaluation and will let Crafty have large     *
*           positional bonuses for significant things, without having the     *
*           small positional advantages add up and cause problems.  V3.8      *
*           exhibited a propensity to "sac the exchange" frequently because   *
*           of this.  it is hoped that this is a thing of the past now.       *
*           also, the "one legal reply to check" algorithm is now being used. *
*           in short, if one side has only one legal reply to a checking move *
*           then the other side is free to check again on the next ply. this  *
*           only applies in the "extension" search, and allows some checks    *
*           that extend() would normally not follow.                          *
*                                                                             *
*    4.1    extension search modified.  it now "tracks" the basic iteration   *
*           search depth up to some user-set limit (default=6).  for shallow  *
*           depths, this speeds things up, while at deeper depths it lets the *
*           program analyze forcing moves somewhat deeper.                    *
*                                                                             *
*    4.2    extension search modified.  fixed a problem where successive      *
*           passed-pawn pushes were not extended correctly by extend() code.  *
*           threat-extension margin was wrong after changing the value of a   *
*           pawn to 1000, it is now back to 1.5 pawns.                        *
*                                                                             *
*    4.3    hash scoring "repaired."  as the piece/square tables changed, the *
*           transposition table (positional evaluation component) along with  *
*           the pawn and king-safety hash tables prevented the changes from   *
*           affecting the score, since the hashed scores were based on the    *
*           old piece/square table values.  now, when any piece/square table  *
*           is modified, the affected hash tables are cleared fo evaluation   *
*           information.                                                      *
*                                                                             *
*    4.4    piece/square tables simplified, king tropism scoring moved to     *
*           Evaluate() where it is computed dynamically now as it should be.  *
*                                                                             *
*    4.5    book move selection algorithm replaced.  Crafty now counts the    *
*           number of times each book move was played as the book file is     *
*           created.  since these moves come (typically) from GM games, the   *
*           more frequently a move appears, the more likely it is to lead to  *
*           a sound position.  Crafty then enumerates all possible book moves *
*           for the current position, computes a probability distribution for *
*           each move so that Crafty will select a move proportional to the   *
*           number of times it was played in GM games (for example, if e4 was *
*           played 55% of the time, then Crafty will play e4 55% of the time) *
*           although the special case of moves played too infrequently is     *
*           handled by letting the operator set a minimum threshold (say 5)   *
*           Crafty won't play moves that are not popular (or are outright     *
*           blunders as the case may be.)  pushing a passed pawn to the 7th   *
*           rank in the basic search [Search() module] now extends the search *
*           by two plies unless we have extended this ply already (usually a  *
*           check evasion) or unless we have extended the whole line to more  *
*           than twice the nominal iteration depth.                           *
*                                                                             *
*    5.0    selective search extensions removed.  with the extensions now in  *
*           the basic full-width search, these became more a waste of time    *
*           than anything useful, and removing them simplifies things quite   *
*           a bit.                                                            *
*                                                                             *
*    5.1    pondering logic now has a "puzzling" feature that is used when    *
*           the search has no move to ponder.  it does a short search to find *
*           a move and then ponders that move, permanently eliminating the    *
*           "idle" time when it has nothing to ponder.                        *
*                                                                             *
*    5.2    evaluation terms scaled down to prevent positional scores from    *
*           reaching the point that sacrificing material to avoid simple      *
*           positional difficulties begins to look attractive.                *
*                                                                             *
*    5.3    performance improvement produced by avoiding calls to MakeMove()  *
*           when the attack information is not needed.  since the first test  *
*           done in Quiesce() is to see if the material score is so bad that  *
*           a normal evaluation and/or further search is futile, this test    *
*           has been moved to inside the loop *before* Quiesce() is           *
*           recursively called, avoiding the MakeMove() work only to          *
*           discover that the resulting position won't be searched further.   *
*                                                                             *
*    5.4    new Swap() function that now understands indirect attacks through *
*           the primary attacking piece(s).  this corrects a lot of sloppy    *
*           move ordering as well as make the "futility" cutoffs added in     *
*           in version 5.3 much more reliable.                                *
*                                                                             *
*    5.5    checks are now back in the quiescence search.  Crafty now stores  *
*           a negative "draft" in the transposition table rather than forcing *
*           any depth < 0 to be zero.  the null-move search now searches the  *
*           null-move to depth-1 (R=1) rather than depth-2 (R=2) which seemed *
*           to cause some tactical oversights in the search.                  *
*                                                                             *
*    5.6    improved move ordering by using the old "killer move" idea.  an   *
*           additional advantage is that the killers can be tried before      *
*           generating any moves (after the captures.)  quiescence now only   *
*           includes "safe" checks (using Swap() to determine if it is a safe *
*           checking move.                                                    *
*                                                                             *
*    5.7    king safety now "hates" a pawn at b3/g3 (white) or b6/g6 (black)  *
*           to try and avoid the resulting mate threats.                      *
*                                                                             *
*    5.8    EvaluateOutsidePassedPawns() fixed to correctly evaluate those    *
*           positions where both sides have outside passed pawns.  before     *
*           this fix, it only evaluated positions where one side had a passed *
*           pawn, which overlooked those won/lost positions where both sides  *
*           have passed pawns but one is "distant" or "outside" the other.    *
*                                                                             *
*    5.9    removed "futility" forward pruning.  exhaustive testing has       *
*           proved that this causes significant tactical oversights.          *
*                                                                             *
*    5.10   added code to handle king and pawn vs king, which understands     *
*           the cases where the pawn can't outrun the king, but has to be     *
*           assisted along by the king.                                       *
*                                                                             *
*    5.11   two king-safety changes.  (1) the program's king safety score is  *
*           now "doubled" to make it much less likely that it will try to win *
*           a pawn but destroy it's king-side.  (2) the attack threshold has  *
*           been lowered which is used to key the program that it is now      *
*           necessary to move pieces to defend the king-side, in an effort to *
*           protect a king-side that is deemed somewhat unsafe.               *
*                                                                             *
*    5.12   improved null-move code by computing the Knuth/Moore node type    *
*           and then only trying null-moves at type 2 nodes.  this has        *
*           resulted in a 2x speedup in test positions.                       *
*                                                                             *
*    5.13   optimization to avoid doing a call to MakeMove() if it can be     *
*           avoided by noting that the move is not good enough to bring the   *
*           score up to an acceptable level.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*    5.14   artificially isolated pawns recognized now, so that Crafty won't  *
*           push a pawn so far it can't be defended.  also, the bonus for a   *
*           outside passed pawn was nearly doubled.                           *
*                                                                             *
*    5.15   passed pawns supported by a king, or connected passed pawns now   *
*           get a large bonus as they advance.  minor fix to the ICC resume   *
*           feature to try to avoid losing games on time.                     *
*                                                                             *
*    6.0    converted to rotated bitboards to make attack generation *much*   *
*           faster.  MakeMove() now can look up the attack bit vectors        *
*           rather than computing them which is significantly faster.         *
*                                                                             *
*    6.1    added a "hung piece" term to Evaluate() which penalizes the side  *
*           to move if a piece is attacked by a lesser piece, or a piece is   *
*           attacked and not defended at all.  additionally, a new scoring    *
*           term was added to detect a weak back rank (where the king does    *
*           not attack an empty square on the 2nd rank, and there are no      *
*           horizontally sliding pieces [rook or queen] on the first rank to  *
*           guard against back-rank mates.                                    *
*                                                                             *
*    6.2    modified the "futility" cutoff to (a) emulate the way the program *
*           normally searches, but avoiding MakeMove() calls when possible,   *
*           and (2) not searching a move near the horizon if the material     *
*           score is hopeless.                                                *
*                                                                             *
*    6.3    null-move code moved from NextMove() directly into Search().      *
*           this results is a "cleaner" implementation, as well as fixing an  *
*           error in the node type, caused by Search() thinking that after    *
*           the first move tried fails to cause a cutoff, that suddenly this  *
*           node is a type=3 node (Knuth and Moore).  this bug would then     *
*           introduce null-moves into later nodes that are a waste of time.   *
*                                                                             *
*    6.4    pawn scoring modified.  passed pawns were scored low enough that  *
*           Crafty would let the opponent create one in the endgame (as long  *
*           as it wasn't an "outside" passed pawn).  this required adjusting  *
*           isolated pawns as well.  all "weak" pawns (pawns on open files    *
*           that aren't defended by a pawn) are not penalized so much if      *
*           there aren't any rooks/queens to attack on the file.              *
*                                                                             *
*    7.0    removed the to.attack and from.attack bitboards.  these are now   *
*           computed as needed, using the rotated bitboards.  hung piece      *
*           stuff removed due to lack of any verified benefit.                *
*                                                                             *
*    7.1    modified next.c and nextc.c so that they check "mvv_lva_ordering" *
*           to determine which capture ordering strategy to use.  note that   *
*           setting this to "1" (default at present) disables the forward     *
*           pruning in quiescence search that wants to cull losing captures.  *
*                                                                             *
*    7.2    major clean-up of MakeMove() using macros to make it easier to    *
*           read and understand.  ditto for other modules as well.  fixed a   *
*           bug in Evaluate() where bishop scoring failed in endgame          *
*           situations, and discouraged king centralization.                  *
*                                                                             *
*    7.3    Evaluate() is no longer called if material is too far outside the *
*           current alpha/beta window.  the time-consuming part of Evaluate() *
*           is no longer done if the major scoring contributors in Evaluate() *
*           haven't pulled the score within the alpha/beta window, and the    *
*           remainder of Evaluate() can't possible accomplish this either.    *
*           gross error in EvaluatePawns() fixed, which would "forget" all    *
*           of the pawn scoring done up to the point where doubled white      *
*           pawns were found.  error was xx=+ rather than xx+=, which had     *
*           an extremely harmful effect on pawn structure evaluation.         *
*                                                                             *
*    7.4    performance improvements produced by elimination of bit-fields.   *
*           this was accomplished by hand-coding the necessary ANDs, ORs, and *
*           SHIFTs necessary to accomplish the same thing, only faster.       *
*                                                                             *
*    7.5    repetition code modified.  it could store at replist[-1] which    *
*           clobbered the long long word just in front of this array.         *
*                                                                             *
*    7.6    null move search now searches with R=2, unless within 3 plies     *
*           of the quiescence search, then it searches nulls with R=1.        *
*                                                                             *
*    8.0    re-vamp of evaluation, bringing scores back down so that Crafty   *
*           will stop sacrificing the exchange, or a piece for two pawns just *
*           it thinks it has lots of positional compensation.  the next few   *
*           versions are going to be tuning or coding modifications to eval.  *
*                                                                             *
*    8.1    Futility() re-written to be more efficient, as well as to stop    *
*           tossing moves out based on the +/- 2 pawn window, which was too   *
*           speculative.  it still saves roughly 20% in speed over the same   *
*           searches without futility, but seems to have *no* harmful effects *
*           in tests run to date.                                             *
*                                                                             *
*    8.2    Futility() removed once and for all.  since MakeMove() is so      *
*           fast after the new attack generation algorithm, this was actually *
*           slower than not using it.                                         *
*                                                                             *
*    8.3    EvaluatePawns() weak pawn analysis bug fixed.  other minor        *
*           performance enhancements and cleanup.                             *
*                                                                             *
*    8.4    dynamic "king tropism" evaluation term now used, which varies     *
*           based on how exposed the target king is.  the more exposed, the   *
*           larger the bonus for placing pieces near the king.  new "analyze" *
*           feature that complements the "annotate" feature that Crafty has   *
*           had for a while.  "annotate" is used to play over moves that are  *
*           either in the current game history, or have been read in using    *
*           the "read <filename>" command.  analyze, on the other hand, will  *
*           immediately begin searching the current position.  each time the  *
*           operator enters a move, it will make that move on the board, and  *
*           then search the resulting position for the other side.  in effect *
*           this gives a running commentary on a "game in progress".  these   *
*           moves can be pumped into Crafty in many ways so that "on the fly" *
*           analysis of a game-in-progress is possible.                       *
*                                                                             *
*    8.5    more cleanup.  pawn promotions were searched twice, thanks to the *
*           killer moves, although often they resulted in no search overhead  *
*           due to transposition table hits the second time around.  other    *
*           minor fixes, including one serious "undefined variable" in        *
*           Evaluate() that caused grief in endings.                          *
*                                                                             *
*    8.6    new book file structure.  it is no longer necessary to enter the  *
*           "number of records" as Crafty now uses a new compressed hashing   *
*           technique so that the book has no empty space in it, and the size *
*           is computed "on the fly" producing a smaller book without the     *
*           user having to compute the size.  tweaks to Evaluate() to cure    *
*           minor irritating habits.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*    8.7    repaired optimization made in null-move search, that forgot to    *
*           clear "EnPassant_Target".  a double pawn push, followed by a null *
*           left the side on move "very confused" and would let it play an    *
*           illegal enpassant capture in the tree. sort.<n> files are now     *
*           removed after book.bin is created.  also, minor change to book    *
*           format makes it incompatible with older book versions, but also   *
*           allows book lines to be as long as desired, and the book size to  *
*           reach any reasonable size.  dynamic king tropism replaced by a    *
*           dynamic computation, but with a static king tropism score, rather *
*           than a score based on king exposure.  there was simply too much   *
*           interaction, although this may prove workable later.              *
*                                                                             *
*    8.8    tweaks to passed pawn scoring.  scores were too low, making       *
*           Crafty "ignore" them too much.                                    *
*                                                                             *
*    8.9    internal iterative deepening is now used in those rare positions  *
*           where a PV node has no hash move to search.  this does a shallow  *
*           search to depth-2 to find a good move for ordering.               *
*                                                                             *
*    8.10   internal interative deepening modified to handle cases where lots *
*           of tactics make the deepening search fail high or low, and        *
*           occasionally end up with no move to try.  this produced a "bad    *
*           move from hash table" error.                                      *
*                                                                             *
*    8.11   minor bug in internal iterative deepening fixed.  also, macros    *
*           for accessing the "position" data structure are now used to make  *
*           things a little more readable.                                    *
*                                                                             *
*    8.12   fixed minor bugs in quiescence checks, which let Crafty include   *
*           more checks than intended (default quiescence_checks=2, but the   *
*           comparison was <= before including a check, which made it include *
*           three.  Additionally, a hashed check was *always* tried, even if  *
*           quiescence_checks had already been satisfied.  pawn scoring also  *
*           had a bug, in that there was a "crack" between opening and middle *
*           game, where Crafty would conclude that it was in an endgame, and  *
*           adjust the pawn advance scores accordingly, sometimes causing an  *
*           odd a4/a5/etc move "out of the blue."  minor bug in next_capture  *
*           was pruning even exchanges very early in quiescence search.  that *
*           has now been removed, so only losing exchanges are pruned.        *
*                                                                             *
*    8.13   NextCapture() now *always* tries checking moves if the move at    *
*           the previous ply was a null-move.  this avoids letting the null   *
*           move hide some serious mating threats.  a minor bug where Crafty  *
*           could draw by repetition after announcing a mate.  this was a     *
*           result of finding a mate score in hash table, and, after the      *
*           search iteration completed, the mate score would terminate the    *
*           search completely.  now, the search won't terminate until it      *
*           finds a mate shorter than the previous search did.  minor eval    *
*           tweaks and bugfixes as well.                                      *
*                                                                             *
*    8.14   checks after null moves discontinued.  worked in some cases, but, *
*           in general made the tree larger for nothing.  eval tweaks to stop *
*           sacs that resulted in connected passed pawns, often at the        *
*           expense of a minor piece for a pawn or two, which usually lost.   *
*           mobility coeffecient increased for all pieces.  asymmetric king   *
*           safety discontinued.  king safety for both sides is now equally   *
*           important.  king safety is now also proportional to the number of *
*           pieces the other side has, so that a disrupted king-side will     *
*           encourage trading pieces to reduce attacking chances.             *
*                                                                             *
*    8.15   weak pawn scoring modified further.  the changes are designed to  *
*           cause Crafty to keep pawns "mobile" where they can advance,       *
*           rather than letting them become blocked or locked.                *
*                                                                             *
*    8.16   still more weak pawn modifications.  in addition, there is no     *
*           "rook on half-open file" any longer.  if there are only enemy     *
*           pawns on the file, and the most advanced one is weak, then the    *
*           file is treated as though it were open.  technical error in the   *
*           EvaluateDevelopment() code that caused screwey evaluations is     *
*           fixed, making Crafty more likely to castle.  :)  Book() now       *
*           verifies that the current position is in book, before trying any  *
*           moves to see if the resulting positions are in book.  This avoids *
*           something like e4 e5 Bb5 a6 Nf3 from causing Crafty to play Nc6   *
*           which takes it back into book, rather than axb5 winning a piece.  *
*           this will occasionally backfire and prevent Crafty from trans-    *
*           posing back into book, but seems safer at present.                *
*                                                                             *
*    8.17   piece values changed somewhat, to avoid Crafty's propensity to    *
*           make unfavorable trades.  an example:  Crafty is faced with the   *
*           loss of a pawn.  instead, it trades the queen for a rook and      *
*           bishop, which used to be the same as losing a pawn.  this is not  *
*           so good, and often would result in a slow loss.  this version     *
*           also implements several "user-supplied" patches to make Crafty    *
*           compile cleanly on various machines.  In addition, you no longer  *
*           have to continually modify types.h for different configurations.  *
*           the Makefile now supplies a -D<target> to the compiler.  you need *
*           to edit Makefile and set "target" to the appropriate value from   *
*           the list provided.  then, when getting a new version, save your   *
*           Makefile, extract the new source, copy in your makefile and you   *
*           will be ready, except for those rare occasions where I add a new  *
*           source module.  other changes are performance tweaks.  one is a   *
*           simple trick to order captures while avoiding Swap() if possible. *
*           if the captured piece is more valuable than the capturing piece,  *
*           we can simply use the difference (pessimistic value) rather than  *
*           calling Swap() since this pessimistic value is still > 0.  other  *
*           tweaks to the various Next_*() routines to avoid a little un-     *
*           necessary work.                                                   *
*                                                                             *
*    8.18   book move selection algorithm changed.  note that this is highly  *
*           speculative, but when best book play is selected, Crafty will     *
*           use the books.bin file as always.  if there is no move in books,  *
*           Crafty reverts to book.bin, but now finds all known book moves    *
*           and puts them into the root move list.  It then does a fairly     *
*           short search, only considering these moves, and it will play the  *
*           best one so long as the evaluation is acceptable.  if not, it     *
*           simply returns as though there was no book move, and executes a   *
*           search as it normally would.  the book hashing algorithm was also *
*           modified so that the 64-bit hash key is slightly different from   *
*           the real hash key.  in effect, the upper 16 bits are only set as  *
*           a result of the side-not-to-move's pieces.  this means that for a *
*           given position, all the book moves will be in the same "cluster"  *
*           which makes the book dramatically faster, since one seek and read *
*           produces all the possible book moves (plus some others too, since *
*           the upper 16 bits are not unique enough.)  A significant speed    *
*           improvement is noticable, particularly with a 60mb opening book.  *
*           Crafty now understands (if that's the right word) that endings    *
*           with bishops of opposite colors are to be avoided.  when such an  *
*           ending is encountered, the total score is simply divided by two   *
*           to make the ending look more drawish.                             *
*                                                                             *
*    8.19   book selection algorithm further modified, so that the result of  *
*           each game in the GM database is known.  now Crafty will not play  *
*           a move from book, if all games were lost by the side on move,     *
*           hopefully avoiding many blunders.  Crafty now understands how to  *
*           attack if both players castle on opposite sides, by encouraging   *
*           pawn advances against the kings.  other minor modifications to    *
*           the eval values.                                                  *
*                                                                             *
*    8.20   PVS search finally implemented fully.  problems several months    *
*           ago prevented doing the PVS search along the PV itself.  this is  *
*           therefore quite a bit faster, now that it's fully implemented and *
*           working properly.  elapsed time code modified so that Crafty now  *
*           uses gettimeofday() to get fractions of a second elapsed time.    *
*           slight modification time allocation algorithm to avoid using too  *
*           much time early in the game.                                      *
*                                                                             *
*    8.21   courtesy of Mark Bromley, Crafty may run significantly faster on  *
*           your machine.  there are some options in the Makefile that will   *
*           eliminate many of the large attack computation long longs, which  *
*           helps prevent cache thrashing.  on some machines this will be     *
*           slower, on others 20% (or maybe more) faster.  you'll have to     *
*           try -DCOMPACT_ATTACKS, and if that's faster, then it's time to    *
*           try -DUSE_SPLIT_SHIFTS which may help even more.  finally, if you *
*           are running on a supersparc processor, you can use the fastattack *
*           assembly module fastattack.s and get another big boost.  (attack  *
*           function is largest compute user in Crafty at present.) serious   *
*           search problem fixed.  it turns out that Crafty uses the hash     *
*           table to pass PV moves from one iteration to the next, but for    *
*           moves at the root of the tree the hash table has no effect, so a  *
*           special case was added to RootMoveList to check the list of moves *
*           and if one matches the PV move, move it to the front of the list. *
*           this turned out to be critical because after completing a search, *
*           (say to 9 plies) Crafty makes its move, then chops the first two  *
*           moves off of the PV and then passes that to iterate to start a    *
*           search.  this search starts at lastdepth-1 (8 in this case) since *
*           the n-2 search was already done.  the "bug" showed up however, in *
*           that RootMoveList() was not checking for the PV move correctly,   *
*           which meant the root moves were ordered by static eval and static *
*           exchange evaluation.  Normally not a serious problem, just that   *
*           move ordering is not so good.  however, suppose that the opponent *
*           takes a real long time to make a move (say 30 seconds) so that    *
*           Crafty completes a 10 ply search.  it then starts the next search *
*           at depth=9, but with the wrong move first.  if the target time is *
*           not large enough to let it resolve this wrong move and get to the *
*           other moves on the list, Crafty is "confused" into playing this   *
*           move knowing absolutely nothing about it.  the result is that it  *
*           can play a blunder easily.  the circumstances leading to this are *
*           not common, but in a 60 move game, once is enough.  PV was pretty *
*           well mis-handled in carrying moves from one search to another     *
*           (not from one iteration to another, but from one complete search  *
*           to another) and has been fixed.  a cute glitch concerning storing *
*           PV from one iteration to another was also fixed, where the score  *
*           stored was confusing the following search.                        *
*                                                                             *
*    8.22   EPD support (courtesy of Steven Edwards [thanks]) is now standard *
*           in Crafty.  for porting, I'll provide a small test run which can  *
*           be used to validate Crafty once it's been compiled.               *
*                                                                             *
*    8.23   cleanup/speedup in hashing.  HashProbe() and HashStore() now      *
*           carefully  cast the boolean operations to the most efficient size *
*           to avoid 64bit operations when only the right 32 bits are         *
*           significant. RepetitionCheck() code completely re-written to      *
*           maintain two repetition lists, one for each side.  Quiesce() now  *
*           handles the repetition check a little different, being careful to *
*           not call it when it's unimportant, but calling it when            *
*           repetitions are possible.                                         *
*                                                                             *
*    8.24   tweaks for king tropism to encourage pieces to collect near the   *
*           king, or to encourage driving them away when being attacked.  a   *
*           modification to Evaluate() to address the problem where Crafty    *
*           is forced to play Kf1 or Kf8, blocking the rook in and getting    *
*           into tactical difficulties as a result.  Book problem fixed where *
*           BookUp was attempting to group moves with a common ancestor       *
*           position together.  unfortunately, captures were separated from   *
*           this group, meaning capture moves in the book could never be      *
*           played.  if a capture was the only move in book, it sort of       *
*           worked because Crafty would drop out of book (not finding the     *
*           capture) and then the search would "save" it.  however, if there  *
*           was a non-capture alternative, it would be forced to play it,     *
*           making it play gambits, and, often, bad ones.  tablebase support  *
*           is now in.  the tablebase files can be downloaded from the ftp    *
*           machine at chess.onenet.net, pub/chess/TB.  currently, Steven     *
*           Edwards has all interesting 4 piece endings done.  to make this   *
*           work, compile with -DTABLEBASES, and create a TB directory where  *
*           Crafty is run, and locate the tablebase files in that directory.  *
*           if you are running under UNIX, TB can be a symbolic or hard link  *
*           to a directory anywhere you want.                                 *
*                                                                             *
*    8.25   minor repair on draw by repetition.  modified how books.bin was   *
*           being used.  now, a move in books.bin has its flags merged with   *
*           the corresponding move from book.bin, but if the move does not    *
*           exist in book.bin, it is still kept as a book move.  repetitions  *
*           are now counted as a draw if they occur two times, period.  the   *
*           last approach was causing problems due to hashing, since the hash *
*           approach used in Crafty is fairly efficient and frequently will   *
*           carry scores across several searches.  this resulted in Crafty    *
*           stumbling into a draw by repetition without knowing.  the con-    *
*           figuration switch HAS-64BITS has been cleaned up and should be    *
*           set for any 64bit architecture now, not just for Cray machines.   *
*                                                                             *
*    8.26   new search extension added, the well-known "one legal response to *
*           check" idea.  if there's only one legal move when in check, we    *
*           extend two plies rather than one, since this is a very forcing    *
*           move.  also, when one side has less than a rook, and the other    *
*           has passed pawns, pushing these pawns to the 6th or 7th rank      *
*           will extend the search one ply, where in normal positions, we     *
*           only extend when a pawn reaches the 7th rank.                     *
*                                                                             *
*    9.0    minor constraint added to most extensions:  we no longer extend   *
*           if the side on move is either significantly ahead or behind,      *
*           depending on the extension.  for example, getting out of check    *
*           won't extend if the side on move is a rook behind, since it's     *
*           already lost anyway.  we don't extend on passed pawn pushes if    *
*           the side on move is ahead a rook, since he's already winning.     *
*           minor adjustments for efficiency as well.  the next few           *
*           versions in this series will have module names in these comments  *
*           indicating which modules have been "cleaned" up.  this is an      *
*           effort at optimizing, although it is currently directed at a line *
*           by line analysis within modules, rather than major changes that   *
*           effect more global ideas.  this type of optimization will come at *
*           a later point in time.                                            *
*                                                                             *
*    9.1    NextMove(), NextCapture() and NextEvasion() were re-structured    *
*           to eliminate unnecessary testing and speed them up significantly. *
*           EvaluateTrades() was completely removed, since Crafty already has *
*           positional scores that encourage/discourage trading based on the  *
*           status of the game.  EvaluateTempo() was evaluated to be a        *
*           failure and was removed completely.                               *
*                                                                             *
*    9.2    Quiesce()) and Search() were modified to be more efficient.  in   *
*           addition, the null-move search was relaxed so that it always does *
*           a search to depth-R, even if close to the end of the tree.        *
*                                                                             *
*    9.3    Check() is no longer used to make sure a position is legal after  *
*           MakeMove() called, but before Search() is called recursively.  We *
*           now use the same approach as Cray Blitz, we make a move and then  *
*           capture the king at the next ply to prove the position is not a   *
*           valid move.  if the side-on-move is already in check, we use      *
*           NextEvasion() which only generates legal moves anyway, so this    *
*           basically eliminates 1/2 of the calls to Check(), a big win.      *
*           this resulted in modifications to Search(), Quiesce(), and        *
*           QuiesceFull().  connected passed pawns on 6th-7th no longer       *
*           trigger search extensions.  solved some problems like Win at      *
*           Chess #2, but overall was a loser.                                *
*                                                                             *
*    9.4    Lookup now checks the transposition table entry and then informs  *
*           Search() when it appears that a null move is useless.  this is    *
*           found when the draft is too low to use the position, but it is at *
*           least as deep as a null-move search would go, and the position    *
*           did not cause a fail-high when it was stored.  king-safety was    *
*           modified again.  the issue here is which king should attract the  *
*           pieces, and for several months the answer has been the king that  *
*           is most exposed attracts *all* pieces.  this has been changed to  *
*           always attract one side's pieces to the other king.  Crafty's     *
*           asymmetric king-safety was making it overly-defensive, even when  *
*           the opponent's king was more exposed.  this should cure that and  *
*           result in more aggressive play.                                   *
*                                                                             *
*    9.5    "vestigial code" (left over from who-knows-when) rmoved from      *
*           Evaluate().  this code used an undefined variable when there was  *
*           no bishop or knight left on the board, and could add in a penalty *
*           on random occasions.  quiescence checks removed completely to see *
*           how this works, since checks extend the normal search significant *
*           amounts in any case.  QuiesceFull() removed and merged into       *
*           Quiesce() which is faster and smaller.  first impression: faster, *
*           simpler, better.  the benefit of no quiescence checks is that the *
*           exhaustive search goes deeper to find positional gains, rather    *
*           than following checks excessively.  No noticable loss in tactical *
*           strength (so far).                                                *
*                                                                             *
*    9.6    legal move test re-inserted in Search() since null-moves could    *
*           make it overlook the fact that a move was illegal.  new assembly  *
*           code for X86 improves performance about 1/3, very similarly to    *
*           the results obtained with the sparc-20 assembly code.  this was   *
*           contributed by Eugene Nalimov and is a welcome addition.          *
*                                                                             *
*    9.7    optimizations continuing.  minor bug in pawn evaluation repaired. *
*           Crafty looked at most advanced white pawn, but least-advanced     *
*           black pawn on a file when doing its weak pawn evaluation.  the    *
*           history heuristic was slightly broken, in that it was supposed to *
*           be incrementing the history count by depth*depth, but this was    *
*           somehow changed to 7*depth, which was not as good.  assembly      *
*           language interface fixed to cleanly make Crafty on all target     *
*           architectures.                                                    *
*                                                                             *
*    9.8    the first change was to borrow a time-allocation idea from Cray   *
*           Blitz.  essentially, when Crafty notices it has used the normal   *
*           time allotment, rather than exiting the search immediately, it    *
*           will wait until it selects the next move at the root of the tree. *
*           the intent of this is that if it has started searching a move     *
*           that is going to be better than the best found so far, this will  *
*           take more time, while a worse move will fail low quickly.  Crafty *
*           simply spends more time to give this move a chance to fail high   *
*           or else quickly fail low.  a fairly serious bug, that's been      *
*           around for a long time, has finally been found/fixed.  in simple  *
*           terms, if the "noise" level was set too high, it could make       *
*           Crafty actually play a bad move.  the more likely effect was to   *
*           see "bad move hashed" messages and the first few lines of output  *
*           from the search often looked funny.  the bug was "noise" was used *
*           as a limit, until that many nodes had been searched, no output    *
*           would be produced.  unfortunately, on a fail-high condition, the  *
*           same code that produced the "++  Nh5" message also placed the     *
*           fail-high move in the PV.  failing to do this meant that the      *
*           search could fail high, but not play the move it found.  most     *
*           often this happened in very fast games, or near the end of long   *
*           zero-increment games.  it now always saves this move as it should *
*           regardless of whether it prints the message or not.               *
*                                                                             *
*    9.9    interface to Xboard changed from -ics to -xboard, so that -ics    *
*           can be used with the custom interface.  additional code to        *
*           communicate with custom interface added.  Search() extensions are *
*           restricted so that there can not be more than one extension at a  *
*           node, rather than the two or (on occasion) more of the last       *
*           version.                                                          *
*                                                                             *
*    9.10   converted to Ken Thompson's "Belle" hash table algorithm.  simply *
*           put, each side has two tables, one that has entries replaced on a *
*           depth-priority only, the other is an "always replace" table, but  *
*           is twice as big.  this allows "deep" entries to be kept along     *
*           with entries close to search point.  basically, when the depth-   *
*           priority table gets a position stored in it, the displaced        *
*           position is moved to the always-replace table.  if the position   *
*           can not replace the depth-priority entry, it always overwrites    *
*           the other always-replace entry.  however, a position is never put *
*           in both tables at the same time.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*    9.11   bug in Search() that could result in the "draft" being recorded   *
*           incorrectly in the hash table.  caused by passing depth, which    *
*           could be one or two plies more than it should be due to the last  *
*           move extending the search.  RepetitionCheck() completely removed  *
*           from Quiesce() since only capture moves are included, and it's    *
*           impossible to repeat a position once a capture has been made.     *
*                                                                             *
*    9.12   optimizations: history.c, other minor modifications.              *
*                                                                             *
*    9.13   EvaluatePawns() modified significantly to simplify and be more    *
*           accurate as well.  pawns on open files are now not directly       *
*           penalized if they are weak, rather the penalty is added when the  *
*           rooks are evaluated.  pawn hashing modified to add more info to   *
*           the data that is hashed.  king safety scores toned down almost    *
*           50% although it is still asymmetric.                              *
*                                                                             *
*    9.14   EvaluatePawns() modified further so that it now does the same     *
*           computations for king safety as the old EvaluateKingSafety*()     *
*           modules did, only it produces four values, two for each king,     *
*           for each side of the board (king or queen-side).  this is now     *
*           hashed with the rest of the pawn scoring, resulting in less       *
*           hashing and computation, and more hits for king-safety too.  king *
*           safety modified further.  asymmetric scoring was accidentally     *
*           disabled several versions ago, this is now enabled again.         *
*                                                                             *
*    9.15   Evaluate() now attempts to recognize the case where a knight is   *
*           trapped on one of the four corner squares, much like a bishop     *
*           trapped at a2/a7/h2/h7.  if a knight is on a corner square, and   *
*           neither of the two potential flight squares are safe (checked by  *
*           Swap()) then a large penalty is given.  this was done to avoid    *
*           positions where Crafty would give up a piece to fork the king and *
*           rook at (say) c7, and pick up the rook at a8 and think it was an  *
*           exchange ahead, when often the knight was trapped and it was      *
*           two pieces for a rook and pawn (or worse.)  two timing bugs fixed *
*           in this version:  (1) nodes_per_second was getting clobbered at   *
*           the end of iterate, which would then corrupt the value stored in  *
*           nodes_between_time_checks and occasionally make Crafty not check  *
*           the time very often and use more time than intended; (2) the      *
*           "don't stop searching after time is out, until the current move   *
*           at the root of the tree has been searched" also would let Crafty  *
*           use time unnecessarily.                                           *
*                                                                             *
*    9.16   significant changes to the way MakeMove() operates.  rather than  *
*           copying the large position[ply] structure around, the piece       *
*           location bitmaps and the array of which piece is on which square  *
*           are now simple global variables.  this means that there is now an *
*           UnMakeMove() function that must be used to restore these after a  *
*           a move has been made.  the benefit is that we avoid copying 10    *
*           bitmaps for piece locations when typically only one is changed,   *
*           ditto for the which piece is on which square array which is 64    *
*           bytes long.  the result is much less memory traffic, with the     *
*           probability that the bitmaps now stay in cache all the time. the  *
*           EvaluatePawns() code now has an exponential-type penalty for      *
*           isolated pawns, but it penalizes the difference between white and *
*           black isolated pawns in this manner.  king evaluation now         *
*           evaluates cases where the king moves toward one of the rooks and  *
*           traps it in either corner.                                        *
*                                                                             *
*    9.17   Xboard compatibility version!  now supports, so far as I know,    *
*           the complete xboard interface, including hint, show thinking,     *
*           taking back moves, "move now" and so forth.  additionally, Crafty *
*           now works with standard xboard.  notice that this means that a    *
*           ^C (interrupt) will no long terminate crafty, because xboard uses *
*           this to implement the "move now" facility.  this should also      *
*           work with winboard and allow pondering, since there is now a      *
*           special windows version of CheckInput() that knows how to check   *
*           Win95 or WinNT pipes when talking with winboard.                  *
*                                                                             *
*    9.18   Xboard compatibility update.  "force" (gnu) mode was broken, so   *
*           that reading in a PGN file (via xboard) would break.  now, Crafty *
*           can track the game perfectly as xboard reads the moves in.  king  *
*           safety modified to discourage g3/g6 type moves without the bishop *
*           to defend the weak squares.  significant other changes to the     *
*           Evaluate() procedure and its derivatives.  very nasty trans/ref   *
*           bug fixed.  been there since transposition tables added.  when    *
*           storing a mate score, it has to be adjusted since it's backed up  *
*           as "mate in n plies from root" but when storing, it must be saved *
*           as "mate in n plies from current position".  trivial, really, but *
*           I overlooked one important fact:  mate scores can also be upper   *
*           or lower search bounds, and I was correcting them in the same way *
*           which is an error.  the effect was that crafty would often find a *
*           mate in 2, fail high on a move that should not fail high, and end *
*           up making a move that would mate in 3.  in particularly bad cases *
*           this would make the search oscillate back and forth and draw a    *
*           won position.  the fix was to only adjust the score if it's a     *
*           score, not if it's a bound.  the "age" field of the trans/ref     *
*           table was expanded to 3 bits.  iterate now increments a counter   *
*           modulo 8, and this counter is stored in the 3 ID bits of the      *
*           trans/ref table.  if they are == the transposition_id counter,    *
*           we know that this is a position stored during the current search. *
*           if not, it's an "old" position.  this avoids the necessity of     *
*           stepping through each entry in the trans/ref table (at the begin- *
*           ning of a search) to set the age bit.  much faster in blitz games *
*           as stepping through the trans/ref table, entry by entry, would    *
*           blow out cache.  this idea was borrowed from Cray Blitz, which    *
*           used this same technique for many years.                          *
*                                                                             *
*    9.19   new evaluation code for passed pawns.  Crafty now gives a large   *
*           bonus for two or more connected passed pawns, once they reach the *
*           sixth rank, when the opponent has less than a queen remaining.    *
*           this will probably be tuned as experience produces the special    *
*           cases that "break" it.  such things as the king too far away or   *
*           the amount of enemy material left might be used to further im-    *
*           prove the evaluation.                                             *
*                                                                             *
*    9.20   bug in SetBoard() fixed.  validity checks for castling status and *
*           en passant status was broken for castle status.  it was checking  *
*           the wrong rook to match castling status, and would therefore not  *
*           accept some valid positions, including #8 in Win At Chess suite.  *
*           minor repetition bug fixed, where Crafty would recognize that a   *
*           three-fold repetition had occurred, but would not claim it when   *
*           playing on a chess server.  Crafty now does not immediately re-   *
*           search the first move when it fails low.  rather, it behaves like *
*           Cray Blitz, and searches all moves.  if all fail low, Crafty will *
*           then relax (lower) alpha and search the complete list again.      *
*           this is a simple gamble that there is another move that will      *
*           "save the day" so that we avoid the overhead of finding out just  *
*           how bad the first move is, only to have more overhead when a good *
*           move fails high.  minor repetition bug fixed.  when running test  *
*           suites of problems, SetBoard() neglected to put the starting      *
*           position in the repetition list, which would occasionally waste   *
*           time.  one notable case was Win At Chess #8, where crafty would   *
*           find Nf7+ Kg8 Nh6+ Kh8 (repeating the original position) followed *
*           by Rf7 (the correct move, but 4 tempi behind.)  Display() bug     *
*           fixed.  Crafty now displays the current board position, rather    *
*           than the position that has been modified by a search in progress. *
*           castling evaluation modified including a bug in the black side    *
*           that would tend to make Crafty not castle queen-side as black if  *
*           the king-side was shredded.  minor bug in Book(). if the book was *
*           turned off (which is done automatically when using the test com-  *
*           mand since several of the Win At Chess positions are from games   *
*           in Crafty's large opening book) Book() would still try to read    *
*           the file and then use the data from the uninitialized buffer.     *
*           this would, on occasion, cause Crafty to crash in the middle of   *
*           a test suite run.                                                 *
*                                                                             *
*    9.21   castling evaluation has been significantly modified to handle the *
*           following three cases better:                                     *
*           (a) one side can castle at the root of the tree, but can not      *
*           castle at a tip position.  if the move that gave up the right to  *
*           castle was *not* a castle move, penalize the score.               *
*           (b) one side can castle short or long at the root, but has al-    *
*           ready castled by the time the search reaches a tip position.      *
*           here the goal is to make sure the player castled to the "better"  *
*           side by comparing king safety where the king really is, to king   *
*           safety had the king castled to the other side.  if the latter is  *
*           "safer" then penalize the current position by the "difference"    *
*           in king safety to encourage that side to delay castling.  this is *
*           a problem when Crafty can castle kingside *now*, but the kingside *
*           has been disrupted somehow.  if the search is not deep enough to  *
*           see clearing out the queenside and castling long, then it will    *
*           often castle short rather than not castle at all.  this fix will  *
*           make it delay, develop the queenside, and castle to a safer king  *
*           shelter, unless tactics force it to castle short.                 *
*           (c) one side can castle short or long at the root, but can only   *
*           castle one way at a tip position, because a rook has been moved.  *
*           if the remaining castle option is worse than castling to the side *
*           where the rook was moved, then we penalize the rook move to keep  *
*           castling to that side open as an option.                          *
*                                                                             *
*    9.22   more castling evaluation changes, to tune how/when Crafty chooses *
*           to castle.  bugs in Option() where certain commands could be ex-  *
*           ecuted while a search was in progress.  if these commands did     *
*           anything to the board position, it would break Crafty badly.      *
*           all that was needed was to check for an active search before some *
*           commands were attempted, and if a search was in progress, return  *
*           to abort the search then re-try the command.  when playing games  *
*           with computers (primarily a chess-server consideration) Crafty is *
*           now defaulting to "book random 0" to use a short search to help   *
*           avoid some ugly book lines on occasion.  in this version, *all*   *
*           positional scores were divided by 2 to reduce the liklihood that  *
*           crafty would sacrifice material and make up the loss with some    *
*           sort of positional gain that was often only temporary.  note that *
*           king safety scores were not reduced while doing this.  new book   *
*           random options:  0=search, 1=most popular move, 2=move that       *
*           produces best positional value, 3=choose from most frequently     *
*           played moves, 4=emulate GM frequency of move selection, 5=use     *
*           sqrt() on frequencies to give more randomness, 6=random.  for     *
*           now, computers get book_random=1, while GM's now get 4 (same as   *
*           before), everyone else gets 5.  until now, there has been no      *
*           penalty for doubled/tripled pawns.  it now exists.  also, if the  *
*           king stands on E1/E8, then the king-side king safety term is used *
*           to discourage disrupting the king-side pawns before castling.     *
*           Crafty now has a start-up initialization file (as most Unix       *
*           programs do).  this file is named ".craftyrc" if the macro UNIX   *
*           is defined, otherwise a "dossy" filename "crafty.rc" is used.     *
*           Crafty opens this file and executes every command in it as though *
*           they were typed by the operator.  the last command *must* be      *
*           "exit" to revert input back to STDIN.                             *
*                                                                             *
*    9.23   more evaluation tuning, including the complete removal of the     *
*           mobility term for rooks/queens.  since rooks already have lots    *
*           of scoring terms like open files, connected, etc, mobility is     *
*           redundant at times and often misleading.  The queen's mobility    *
*           is so variable it is nearly like introducing a few random points  *
*           at various places in the search.  minor Xboard compatibility bug  *
*           fixed where you could not load a game file, then have crafty play *
*           by clicking the "machine white" or "machine black" options.       *
*                                                                             *
*    9.24   minor bug in Quiesce() repaired.  when several mate-in-1 moves    *
*           were available at the root, Crafty always took the last one,      *
*           which was often an under-promotion to a rook rather than to a     *
*           queen.  It looked silly and has been fixed so that it will play   *
*           the first mate-in-1, not the last.  RootMoveList() went to great  *
*           pains to make sure that promotion to queen occurs before rook.    *
*           bug in EvaluateOutsidePassedPawns() would fail to recognize that  *
*           one side had an outside passer, unless both sides had at least    *
*           one passer, which failed on most cases seen in real games.        *
*           minor "tweak" to move ordering.  GenerateMoves() now uses the     *
*           LastOne() function to enumerate white moves, while still using    *
*           FirstOne() for black moves.  this has the effect of moving pieces *
*           toward your opponent before moving them away.  a severe oversight *
*           regarding the use of "!" (as in wtm=!wtm) was found and corrected *
*           to speed things up some.  !wtm was replaced by wtm^1 (actually,   *
*           a macro ChangeSide(wtm) is used to make it more readable) which   *
*           resulted in significant speedup on the sparc, but a more modest   *
*           improvement on the pentium.                                       *
*                                                                             *
*    9.25   minor bug in Book() fixed where it was possible for crafty to     *
*           play a book move that was hardly ever played.  minor change to    *
*           time utilization to use a little more time "up front".  tuned     *
*           piece/square tables to improve development some.  saw Crafty lose *
*           an occasional game because (for example) the bishop at c1 or c8   *
*           had not moved, but the king had already castled, which turned the *
*           EvaluateDevelopment() module "off".  first[ply] removed, since it *
*           was redundant with last[ply-1].  the original intent was to save  *
*           a subscript math operation, but the compilers are quite good with *
*           the "strength-reduction" optimization, making referencing a value *
*           by first[ply] or last[ply-1] exactly the same number of cycles.   *
*           passed pawn scores increased.  the reduction done to reduce all   *
*           scores seemed to make Crafty less attentive to passed pawns and   *
*           the threats they incur.  Minor bug in Book() fixed, the variable  *
*           min_percent_played was inoperative due to incorrect test on the   *
*           book_status[n] value.  pawn rams now scored a little differently, *
*           so that pawn rams on Crafty's side of the board are much worse    *
*           than rams elsewhere.  This avoids positional binds where, for ex- *
*           ample Crafty would like black with pawns at e6 d5 c6, white with  *
*           pawns at e5 and c5.  black has a protected passed pawn at d5 for  *
*           sure, but the cramp makes it easy for white to attack black, and  *
*           makes it difficult for black to defend because the black pawns    *
*           block the position badly.  king safety tweaked up about 30%, due  *
*           to using nearly symmetrical scoring, the values had gotten too    *
*           small and were not overriding minor positional things.            *
*                                                                             *
*    9.26   minor bug fixes in time allocation.  this mainly affects Crafty   *
*           as it plays on a chess server.  the problem is, simply, that the  *
*           current internal timing resolution is 1/10 of a second, kept in   *
*           an integer variable.  .5 seconds is stored as 5, for example.     *
*           this became a problem when the target time for a search dropped   *
*           below .3 seconds, because the "easy move" code would terminate    *
*           the search after 1/3 of the target time elapsed if there were no  *
*           fail lows or PV changes.  unfortunately, 2 divided by 3 (.2 secs  *
*           /3) is "zero" which would let the search quickly exit, possibly   *
*           without producing a PV with a move for Crafty to play.  Crafty    *
*           would play the first PV move anyway, which was likely the PV move *
*           from the last search.  this would corrupt the board information,  *
*           often produce the error "illegal move" when the opponent tried to *
*           move, or, on occasion, blow crafty up.  on a chess server, Crafty *
*           would simply flag and lose.  after this fix, I played several     *
*           hundred games with a time control of 100 moves in 1 second and    *
*           there were no failures.  before the fix, this time control could  *
*           not result in a single completed game.  if you don't run Crafty   *
*           on a chess server, this version is not important, probably. a     *
*           minor fix for move input, so that moves like e2e4 will always be  *
*           accepted, where before they would sometimes be flagged as errors. *
*                                                                             *
*    9.27   this version has an interesting modification to NextCapture().    *
*           Quiesce() now passes alpha to NextCapture() and if a capture      *
*           appears to win material, but doesn't bring the score up to the    *
*           value of alpha, the capture is ignored.  in effect, if we are so  *
*           far behind that a capture still leaves us below alpha, then there *
*           is nothing to gain by searching the capture because our opponent  *
*           can simply stand pat at the next ply leaving the score very bad.  *
*           one exception is if the previous ply was in check, we simply look *
*           for any safe-looking capture just in case it leads to mate.  bad  *
*           book bug with book random=1 or 2 fixed (this is set when playing  *
*           a computer).  this bug would cause crafty to play an illegal move *
*           and bust wide open with illegal move errors, bad move hashed, and *
*           other things.  book randomness also quite a bit better now.       *
*                                                                             *
*    9.28   piece/square table added for rooks.  primary purpose is to dis-   *
*           courage rooks moving to the edge of the board but in front of     *
*           pawns, where it is easy to trap it.  Crafty now understands the   *
*           concept of blockading a passed pawn to prevent it from advancing. *
*           it always understood that advancing one was good, which would     *
*           tend to encourage blockading, but it would also often ignore the  *
*           pawn and let it advance a little here, a little there, until it   *
*           suddenly realized that it was a real problem.  the command to set *
*           the size of the hash table has been modified.  this command is    *
*           now "hash n", "hash nK" or "hash nM" to set the hash table to one *
*           of bytes, Kbytes, or Mbytes.  Note that if the size is not an     *
*           exact multiple of what crafty needs, it silently reduces the size *
*           to an optimum value as close to the suggested size as possible.   *
*           trade bonus/penalty is now back in, after having been removed     *
*           when the new UnMake() code was added.  crafty now tries to trade  *
*           pawns but not pieces when behind, and tries to trade pieces but   *
*           not pawns when ahead.  EvaluateDraws() now understands that rook  *
*           pawns + the wrong bishop is a draw.  minor adjustment to the      *
*           quiescence-search pruning introduced in 9.27, to avoid excluding  *
*           captures that didn't lose material, but looked bad because the    *
*           positional score was low.  slightly increased the values of the   *
*           pieces relative to that of a pawn to discourage the tendency to   *
*           trade a piece for two or three pawns plus some positional plusses *
*           that often would slowly vanish.  null-move search modified to try *
*           null-moves, even after captures.  this seems to hurt some prob-   *
*           lem positions, but speeds up others significantly.  seems better  *
*           but needs close watching.  EvaluateDraws() call moved to the top  *
*           of Evaluate() to check for absolute draws first.  Quiesce() now   *
*           always calls Evaluate() which checks for draws before trying the  *
*           early exit tests to make sure that draws are picked up first.     *
*           EvaluateDraws() substantially re-written to get rid of lots of    *
*           unnecessary instructions, and to also detect RP+B of wrong color  *
*           even if the losing side has a pawn of its own.  Crafty would      *
*           often refuse to capture that last pawn to avoid reaching an end-  *
*           game it knew was drawn.                                           *
*                                                                             *
*    9.29   new time.c as contributed by Mike Byrne.  basically makes Crafty  *
*           use more time up front, which is a method of anticipating that    *
*           Crafty will predict/ponder pretty well and save time later on     *
*           anyway.  InCheck() is never called in Quiesce() now.  as a        *
*           result, Crafty won't recognize mates in the q-search.  this has   *
*           speeded the code up with no visible penalty, other than it will   *
*           occasionally find a win of material rather than a mate score, but *
*           this has not affected the problem suite results in a measurable   *
*           way, other than crafty is now about 10% faster in average type    *
*           position, and much faster in others.  the latest epd code from    *
*           Steven Edwards is a part of this version, which includes updated  *
*           tablebase access code.                                            *
*                                                                             *
*   10.0    new time.c with a "monitoring feature" that has two distinct      *
*           functions:  (1) monitor crafty's time remaining and if it is too  *
*           far behind the opponent, force it to speed up, or if it is well   *
*           ahead on time, slow down some;  (2) if opponent starts moving     *
*           quickly, crafty will speed up as well to avoid getting too far    *
*           behind.  EvaluateDraws() modified to detect that if one side has  *
*           insufficient material to win, the score can never favor that side *
*           which will make Crafty avoid trading into an ending where it has  *
*           KNN vs KB for example, where KNN seems to be ahead.               *
*                                                                             *
*   10.1    new book.c.  crafty now counts wins, losses and draws for each    *
*           possible book move and can use these to play a move that had a    *
*           high percentage of wins, vs the old approach of playing a move    *
*           just because it was played a lot in the past.                     *
*                                                                             *
*   10.2    evaluation tuning.  rook on 7th, connected rooks on 7th, etc.,    *
*           are now more valuable.  Crafty was mistakenly evaluating this     *
*           too weakly.  book() changed so that the list of moves is first    *
*           sorted based on winning percentages, but then, after selecting    *
*           the sub-set of this group, the list is re-sorted based on the     *
*           raw total games won so that the most popular opening is still the *
*           most likely to be played.                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   10.3    timer resolution changed to 1/100th of a second units, with all   *
*           timing variables conforming to this, so that it is unnecessary    *
*           to multiply by some constant to convert one type of timing info   *
*           to the standard resolution.  bug in evaluate.c fixed.  trapped    *
*           rook (rook at h1, king at g1 for example) code had a bad sub-     *
*           script that caused erroneous detection of a trapped rook when     *
*           there was none.                                                   *
*                                                                             *
*   10.4    Quiesce() no longer checks for time exceeded, nor does it do any  *
*           hashing whatsoever, which makes it significantly faster, while    *
*           making the trees only marginally bigger.                          *
*                                                                             *
*   10.5    Quiesce() now calls GenerateCaptures() to generate capture moves. *
*           this new move generator module is significantly faster, which     *
*           speeds the quiescence search up somewhat.                         *
*                                                                             *
*   10.6    CastleStatus is now handled slightly differently.  the right two  *
*           bits still indicate whether or not that side can castle to either *
*           side, and 0 -> no castling at all, but now, <0 means that no      *
*           castling can be done, and that castling rights were lost by       *
*           making a move that was not castling.  this helps in Evaluate()    *
*           by eliminating a loop to see if one side castled normally or had  *
*           to give up the right to castle for another (bad) reason.  this is *
*           simply an efficiency issue, and doesn't affect play or anything   *
*           at all other than to make the search faster.                      *
*                                                                             *
*   10.7    NextMove() now doesn't try history moves forever, rather it will  *
*           try the five most popular history moves and if it hasn't gotten a *
*           cutoff by then, simply tries the rest of the moves without the    *
*           history testing, which is much faster.                            *
*                                                                             *
*   10.8    Book() now "puzzles" differently.  In puzzling, it is trying to   *
*           find a move for the opponent.  since a book move by the opponent  *
*           will produce an instant move, puzzle now enumerates the set of    *
*           legal opponent moves, and from this set, removes the set of known *
*           book moves and then does a quick search to choose the best.  we   *
*           then ponder this move just in case the opponent drops out of book *
*           and uses a normal search to find a move.  Crafty now penalizes    *
*           a pawn that advances, leaving its neighbors behind where both     *
*           the advancing pawn, and the ones being left behind become weaker. *
*           the opening phase of the game has been modified to "stay active"  *
*           until all minor pieces are developed and Crafty has castled, to   *
*           keep EvaluateDevelopment() active monitoring development.  minor  *
*           change to DrawScore() so that when playing a computer, it will    *
*           return "default_draw_score" under all circumstances rather than   *
*           adjusting this downward, which makes Crafty accept positional     *
*           weaknesses rather than repeat a position.                         *
*                                                                             *
*   10.9    Evaluate() now handles king safety slightly differently, and      *
*           increases the penalty for an exposed king quite a bit when there  *
*           is lots of material present, but scales this increase down as the *
*           material comes off.  this seems to help when attacking or getting *
*           attacked.  since Quiesce() no longer probes the hash table, the   *
*           idea of storing static evaluations there became worthless and was *
*           burning cycles that were wasted.  this has been removed. check    *
*           extensions relaxed slightly so that if ply is < iteration+10 it   *
*           will allow the extension.  old limit was 2*iteration.  connected  *
*           passed pawns on 6th now evaluated differently.  they get a 1 pawn *
*           bonus, then if material is less than a queen, another 1 pawn      *
*           bonus, and if not greater than a rook is left, and the king can't *
*           reach the queening square of either of the two pawns, 3 more      *
*           more pawns are added in for the equivalent of + a rook.           *
*                                                                             *
*   10.10   Evaluate() modified.  king safety was slightly broken, in that    *
*           an uncastled king did not get a penalty for open center files.    *
*           new evaluation term for controlling the "absolute 7th rank", a    *
*           concept from "My System".                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   10.11   lazy evaluation implemented.  now as the Evaluate() code is ex-   *
*           ecuted, crafty will "bail out" when it becomes obvious that the   *
*           remainder of the evaluation can't bring the score back inside the *
*           alpha/beta window, saving time.                                   *
*                                                                             *
*   10.12   more Jakarta time control commands added so operator can set the  *
*           time accurately if something crashes, and so the operator can set *
*           a "cushion" to compensate for operator inattention.  "easy" is    *
*           more carefully qualified to be a recapture, or else a move that   *
*           preserves the score, rather than one that appears to win material *
*           as was done in the past.  king safety tweaked a little so that if *
*           one side gives up the right to castle, and could castle to a safe *
*           position, the penalty for giving up the right is substantially    *
*           larger than before.  a minor bug also made it more likely for     *
*           black to give up the right to castle than for white.              *
*                                                                             *
*   10.13   modifications to Book() so that when using "book random 0" mode   *
*           (planned for Jakarta) and the search value indicates that we are  *
*           losing a pawn, we return "out of book" to search *all* the moves, *
*           not just the moves that are "in book."  This hopefully avoids     *
*           some book lines that lose (gambit) material unsoundly.            *
*                                                                             *
*   10.14   final timing modifications.  puzzling/booking searches now take   *
*           1/30th of the normal time, rather than 1/10th.  new command       *
*           "mode=tournament" makes crafty assess DRAW as "0" and also makes  *
*           it prompt the operator for time corrections as required by WMCCC  *
*           rules.                                                            *
*                                                                             *
*   10.15   Evaluate() tuning to reduce development bonuses, which were able  *
*           to overwhelm other scores and lead to poor positions.             *
*                                                                             *
*   10.16   "lazy" (early exit) caused some problems in Evaluate() since so   *
*           many scores are very large.  scaled this back significantly and   *
*           also EvaluateOutsidePassedPawns() could double the score if one   *
*           side had passers on both sides.  this was fixed.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   10.17   crafty's Book() facility has been significantly modified to be    *
*           more understandable.  book random <n> has the following options:  *
*           (0) do a search on set of book moves; (1) choose from moves that  *
*           are played most frequently; (2) choose from moves with best win   *
*           ratio; (3) choose from moves with best static evaluation; and     *
*           (4) choose completely randomly.  book width <n> can be used to    *
*           control how large the "set" of moves will be, with the moves in   *
*           the "set" being the best (according to the criteria chosen) from  *
*           the known book moves.  minor tweak to Search() so that it extends *
*           passed pawn pushes to the 6th or 7th rank if the move is safe,    *
*           and this is an endgame.                                           *
*                                                                             *
*   10.18   new annotate command produces a much nicer analysis file and also *
*           lets you exert control over what has to happen to trigger a com-  *
*           ment among other things.  AKA Crafty/Jakarta version.             *
*                                                                             *
*   11.1    fractional depth allows fractional ply increments.  the reso-     *
*           lution is 1/60 of a ply, so all of the older "depth++" lines now  *
*           read depth+=PLY, where #define PLY 60 is used everywhere.  this   *
*           gives added flexibility in that some things can increment the     *
*           depth by < 1 ply, so that it takes two such things before the     *
*           search actually extends one ply deeper.  Crafty now has full PGN  *
*           support.  a series of pgn commands (pgn Event 14th WMCCC) allow   *
*           the PGN tags to be defined, when crafty reads or annotates a PGN  *
*           file it reads and parses the headers and will display the info    *
*           in the annotation (.can) file or in the file you specify when you *
*           execute a "savegame <filename>" command.                          *
*                                                                             *
*   11.2    fractional ply increments now implemented.  11.1 added the basic  *
*           fractional ply extension capabilities, but this version now uses  *
*           them in Search().  there are several fractional ply extensions    *
*           being used, all are #defined in types.h to make playing with them *
*           somewhat easier.  one advantage is that now all extensions are    *
*           3/4 of a ply, which means the first time any extension is hit, it *
*           has no effect, but the next three extensions will result in an    *
*           additional ply, followed by another ply where the extension does  *
*           nothing, followed by ...  this allowed me to remove the limit on  *
*           how deep in the tree the extensions were allowed, and also seems  *
*           to not extend as much unless there's "something" going on.  when  *
*           the position gets interesting, these kick in.  asymmetric king    *
*           safety is back in.  Crafty's king safety is a little more im-     *
*           portant than the opponent's now to help avoid getting its king-   *
*           side shredded to win a pawn.  a new term, ROOK_ON_7TH_WITH_PAWN   *
*           to help Crafty understand how dangerous a rook on the 7th is if   *
*           it is supported by a pawn.  it is difficult to drive off and the  *
*           pawn provides additional threats as well.                         *
*                                                                             *
*   11.3    king safety modifications.  one fairly serious bug is that Crafty *
*           considered that king safety became unimportant when the total     *
*           pieces dropped below 16 material points.  note that this was      *
*           pieces only, not pieces and pawns, which left plenty of material  *
*           on the board to attack with.  as a result, Crafty would often     *
*           allow its king-side to be weakened because it was either in an    *
*           endgame, or close to an endgame.  *incorrectly*, it turns out. :) *
*           going back to a very old Crafty idea, king tropism is now tied to *
*           how exposed each king is, with pieces being attracted to the most *
*           exposed king for attack/defense.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*   11.4    tuning on outside passed pawn code.  values were not large enough *
*           and didn't emphasize how strong such a pawn is.  general passed   *
*           pawn value increased as well.  minor bug in edit that would let   *
*           crafty flag in some wild games was fixed.  basically, edit has no *
*           way to know if castling is legal, and has to assume if a rook and *
*           king are on the original squares, castling is o.k.  for wild2     *
*           games in particular, this can fail because castling is illegal    *
*           (by the rules for wild 2) while it might be that rooks and king   *
*           are randomly configured to make it look possible.  crafty would   *
*           then try o-o or o-o-o and flag when the move was rejected as      *
*           illegal.  Richard Lloyd suggested a speed-up for the annotate     *
*           command which I'm using temporarily.  Crafty now searches all     *
*           legal moves in a position, and if the best move matches the game  *
*           move, the second search of just the move played is not needed.  I *
*           was searching just the game move first, which was a waste of time *
*           in many positions.  I'll resume this later, because I want to see *
*           these values:  (1) score for move actually played; (2) score for  *
*           the rest of the moves only, not including the move actually       *
*           played, to see how often a player finds a move that is the *only* *
*           good move in a position.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   11.5    more fractional ply extension tuning.  a few positions could blow *
*           up the search and go well beyond 63 plies, the max that Crafty    *
*           can handle.  now, extensions are limited to no more than one ply  *
*           of extensions for every ply of search.  note that "in check" is   *
*           extended on the checking move ply, not on the out of check ply,   *
*           so that one-reply-to-check still extends further.  minor changes  *
*           to time.c to further help on long fast games.  another important  *
*           timing bug repaired.  if Crafty started an iteration, and failed  *
*           high on the first move, it would not terminate the search until   *
*           this move was resolved and a score returned.  this could waste a  *
*           lot of time in already won positions.  interesting bug in the     *
*           capture search pruning fixed.  at times, a piece would be hung,   *
*           but the qsearch would refuse to try the capture because it would  *
*           not bring the score back to above alpha.  unfortunately, taking   *
*           the piece could let passed pawns race in undisturbed which would  *
*           affect the score.  this pruning is turned off when there are not  *
*           at least two pieces left on the board.  another bug in the move   *
*           generator produced pawn promotions twice, once when captures were *
*           generated, then again when the rest of the moves are produced.    *
*           this was also repaired.  small book now will work.  the BookUp()  *
*           code now assumes white *and* black won in the absence of a valid  *
*           PGN Result tag, so that the small book will work correctly.       *
*                                                                             *
*   11.6    modifications to time allocation in a further attempt to make     *
*           Crafty speed up if time gets short, to avoid flagging.  it is now *
*           *very* difficult to flag this thing.  :)  minor evaluation tweaks *
*           and a fix to Quiesce() to speed it up again after a couple of bad *
*           fixes slowed things down.                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   11.7    minor modification to Evaluate().  rooks behind a passed pawn are *
*           good, but two rooks behind the pawn don't help if the pawn is     *
*           blockaded and can't move, unless the two rooks are not the same   *
*           color as the pawn.                                                *
*                                                                             *
*   11.8    first stage of "book learning" implemented.  Crafty monitors the  *
*           search evaluation for the first 10 moves out of book.  it then    *
*           computes a "learn value" if it thinks this set of values shows    *
*           that the book line played was very good or very bad.  this value  *
*           is added to a "learn count" for each move in the set of book      *
*           moves it played, with the last move getting the full learn value, *
*           and moves closer to the start of the game getting a smaller       *
*           percentage.  (see learn.c for more details).  these values are    *
*           used by Book() to help in selecting/avoiding book lines.  Crafty  *
*           produces a "book.lrn" file that synthesizes this information into *
*           a portable format that will be used by other crafty programs,     *
*           once the necessary code is added later on.                        *
*                                                                             *
*   11.9    an age-old problem caused by null-move searching was eliminated   *
*           in this version.  often the null-move can cause a move to fail    *
*           high when it should not, but then the move will fail low on the   *
*           re-search when beta is relaxed.  this would, on occasion, result  *
*           in Crafty playing a bad move for no reason.  now, if a fail high  *
*           is followed by a fail-low, the fail high condition is ignored.    *
*           this can be wrong, but with null-move pruning, it can also be     *
*           even "more wrong" to accept a fail high move after it fails low   *
*           due to a null-move failure, than it would be right to accept the  *
*           fail high/fail low that is caused by trans/ref table anomalies.   *
*                                                                             *
*   11.10   Crafty is now using the Kent, et. al, "razoring" algorithm, which *
*           simply eliminates the last ply of full-width searching and goes   *
*           directly to the capture search if the move before the last full-  *
*           width ply is uninteresting, and the Material eval is 1.5 pawns    *
*           below alpha.  It's a "modest futility" idea that doesn't give up  *
*           on the uninteresting move, but only tries captures after the move *
*           is played in the tree.  net result is 20-30% average faster times *
*           to reach the same depth.  minor mod to book.lrn to include Black, *
*           White and Date PGN tags just for reference.  next learning mod is *
*           another "book random n" option, n=3.  this will use the "learned" *
*           score to order book moves, *if* any of them are > 0.  what this   *
*           does is to encourage Crafty to follow opening lines that have     *
*           been good, even if the learn count hasn't reached the current     *
*           threshold of 1,000.  this makes learning "activate" faster.  this *
*           has one hole in it, in that once crafty learns that one move has  *
*           produced a positive learn value, it will keep playing that move   *
*           (since no others will yet have a positive value) until it finally *
*           loses enough to take the learn value below zero.  this will be    *
*           taken care of in the next version, hopefully.                     *
*                                                                             *
*   11.11   new "book random 4" mode that simply takes *all* learning scores  *
*           for the set of legal book moves, translates them so that the      *
*           worst value is +1 (by adding -Min(all_scores)+1 to every learn    *
*           value) and then squaring the result.  this encourages Crafty to   *
*           follow book lines that it has learned to be good, while still     *
*           letting it try openings that it has not yet tried (learn value    *
*           =0) and even lets it try (albeit rarely) moves that it has        *
*           learned to be bad.  minor evaluation tweaking for king placement  *
*           in endgames to encourage penetration in the center rather than on *
*           a wing where the king might get too far from the "action."        *
*                                                                             *
*   11.12   LearnFunction() now keeps positional score, rather than using a   *
*           constant value for scores < PAWN_VALUE, to improve learning       *
*           accuracy.  book learn <filename> [clear] command implemented to   *
*           import learning files from other Crafty programs.                 *
*                                                                             *
*   11.13   endgame threshold lowered to the other side having a queen or     *
*           less (9) rather than (13) points.  queen+bishop can be very       *
*           dangerous to the king for example, or two rooks and a bishop.     *
*           learning "curve" modified.  it was accidentally left in a sort    *
*           of "geometric" shape, with the last move getting the full learn   *
*           value, the next one back getting 1/2, the next 1/3, etc.   now    *
*           it is uniformly distributed from front to back.  if there are 20  *
*           moves, the last gets the full value, the next gets 19/20, etc..   *
*           also the "percentage played" was hosed and is fixed.              *
*                                                                             *
*   11.14   minor modification to book learn 4 code so that when you start    *
*           off with *no* learned data, Book() won't exclude moves from the   *
*           possible set of opening moves just because one was not played     *
*           very often.  due to the lack of "ordering" info in this case, it  *
*           would often discover the second or third move in the list had not *
*           been played very often and cull the rest of the list thinking it  *
*           was ordered by the number of times it was played.  new channel=n  *
*           command works with old whisper command, but takes what Crafty     *
*           would normally whisper and directs it to channel "n" instead.     *
*           primarily used with custom interface when observing a game on a   *
*           server.  this lets other observers either listen or ignore the    *
*           analysis Crafty produces by using +chan n or -chan n.  this code  *
*           contains all of Frank's xboard patches so that analyze mode and   *
*           so forth works cleanly.  a new book random option <5> modifies    *
*           the probability of playing a move by letting the popularity of a  *
*           move affect the learned-value sorting algorithm somewhat. minor   *
*           adjustment in pawn ram asymmetric term to simply count rams and   *
*           not be too concerned about which half of the board they are on.   *
*           adjustment to weak pawn code.  also increased bonus for king      *
*           tropism to attract pieces toward enemy king to improve attacking. *
*           code that detects drawn K+RP+wrong bishop had a bug in that on    *
*           occasion, the defending king might not be able to reach the       *
*           queening square before the opposing king blocks it out.  this     *
*           would let some positions look like draws when they were not. king *
*           safety now uses square(7-distance(piece,king)) as one multiplier  *
*           to really encourage pieces to get closer to the king.  in cases   *
*           whre one king is exposed, all pieces are attracted to that king   *
*           to attack or defend.   this is turned off during the opening.     *
*           minor 50-move rule draw change to fix a bug, in that the game is  *
*           not necessarily a draw after 50 moves by both sides, because one  *
*           side might be mated by the 50th move by the other side.  this     *
*           occurred in a game Crafty vs Ferret, and now works correctly.     *
*                                                                             *
*   11.15   modified LearnBook() so that when Crafty terminates, or resigns,  *
*           or sees a mate, it will force LearnBook() to execute the learning *
*           analysis even if 10 moves have not been made sine leaving the     *
*           book.  Crafty now trusts large positive evals less when learning  *
*           about an opening, since such evals are often the result of the    *
*           opponent's blunder, rather than a really  good opening line.      *
*           second learning stage implemented.  Crafty maintains a permanent  *
*           hash file that it uses to store positions where the search value  *
*           (at the root of the tree) suddenly drop, and then it "seeds" the  *
*           real transposition table with these values at the start of each   *
*           of each search so that information is available earlier the next  *
*           time this game is played.  position.bin has the raw binary data   *
*           this uses, while position.lrn has the "importable" data.  new     *
*           import <filename> [clear] command imports all learning data now,  *
*           eliminating the old book learn command.  LearnFunction() modified *
*           to handle "trusted" values (negative scores, because we are sure  *
*           that Crafty won't make an outright blunder very often) and        *
*           "untrusted" values (positive values often caused by the opponent  *
*           hanging a piece.  trusted values are scaled up if the opponent is *
*           weaker than crafty since a weaker opponent forcing a negative     *
*           eval means the position must really be bad, and are scaled down   *
*           somewhat if the opponent is stronger than crafty (from the rating *
*           information from ICC or the operator using the rating command.)   *
*           untrusted values are scaled down harshly, unless the opponent is  *
*           much stronger than crafty, since it is unlikely such an opponent  *
*           would really blunder, while weaker opponents drastically scale    *
*           untrusted value (which is positive, remember) down.  minor depth  *
*           problem fixed in learning code.  the depth used in LearnFunction  *
*           was not the depth for the search that produced the "learn value"  *
*           the LearnBook() chooses, it was the depth for the search last     *
*           done.  now, in addition to the 10 last search values, I store the *
*           depth for each as well.  when a particular search value is used   *
*           to "learn", the corresponding (correct) depth is also now used.   *
*           these learn values are now limited to +6000/-6000 because in one  *
*           book line, Crafty discovered it was getting mated in 2 moves at   *
*           the end of the book line which was 30 moves deep.  if you try to  *
*           distribute a "mate score" as the learned value, it will instantly *
*           make every move for the last 26 moves look too bad to play.  this *
*           is not desirable, rather the last few moves should be unplayable, *
*           but other moves further back should be o.k.  another bug that let *
*           Crafty overlook the above mate also fixed.  the search value was  *
*           not correct if Crafty got mated, which would avoid learning in    *
*           that case.  this has been fixed, although it was obviously a rare *
*           problem anyway.  minor draw bug fixed, where crafty would offer   *
*           a draw when time was way low, caused by the resolution change a   *
*           few months back, and also it would offer a draw after the         *
*           opponent moved, even if he made a blunder.  it now only offers a  *
*           draw after moving to make sure it's reasonable.  Crafty now won't *
*           resign if there is a deep mate, such as a mate in 10+, because we *
*           want to be sure that the opponent can demonstrate making progress *
*           before we toss in the towel.  LearnBook() now learns on all games *
*           played.  the old algorithm had a serious problem in that negative *
*           scores were trusted fully, positive scores were treated with low  *
*           confidence, and scores near zero were ignored totally.  the net   *
*           result was that learning values became more and more negative as  *
*           games were played.  now equal positions are also factored in to   *
*           the learning equation to help pull some of these negative values  *
*           back up.  Book() now excludes moves that have not been played     *
*           many times (if there is at least one move that has) for book      *
*           random = 2, 3 and 4.  This stops some of the silly moves.         *
*           position learning is turned off after 15 moves have passed since  *
*           leaving book, to avoid learning things that won't be useful at a  *
*           later time.  hashing changed slightly to include "permanent"      *
*           entries so that the learned stuff can be copied into the hash     *
*           table with some confidence that it will stay there long enough to *
*           be used.                                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   11.16   king tropism toned down a little to not be quite so intent on     *
*           closeness to the kings, so that other positional ideas don't get  *
*           "lost" in the eval.  back to normal piece values (1,3,3,5,9) for  *
*           a while.  optimizations in Quiesce() speeded things up about 2%.  *
*           pawns pushed toward the king are not so valuable any more so that *
*           Crafty won't prefer to hold on to them rather than trading to     *
*           open a file(s) on the enemy king.  BookLearn() call was moved in  *
*           Resign() so that it first learns, then resigns, so that it won't  *
*           get zapped by a SIGTERM right in the middle of learning when      *
*           xboard realizes the game is over.  edit/setboard logic modified   *
*           so that it is now possible to back up, and move forward in a game *
*           that was set up via these commands.                               *
*                                                                             *
*   11.17   EvaluatePawns() modified to eliminate "loose pawn" penalty which  *
*           was not particularly effective and produced pawn scores that were *
*           sometimes misleading.  several optimizations dealing with cache   *
*           efficiency, primarily changing int's to signed char's so that     *
*           multiple values fit into a cache line together, to eliminate some *
*           cache thrashing.  PopCnt() no longer used to recognize that we    *
*           have reached an endgame database, there's now a counter for the   *
*           total number of pieces on the board, as it's much faster to inc   *
*           and dec that value rather than count 1 bits.  tweaks to MakeMove  *
*           and UnMakeMove to make things a couple of percent faster, but a   *
*           whole lot cleaner.  ditto for Swap and Quiesce.  more speed, and  *
*           cleaner code.  outside passed pawn scored scaled down except when *
*           the opponent has no pieces at all.  "lazy eval" cleaned up.  we   *
*           now have two early exits, one before king safety and one after    *
*           king safety.  there are two saved values so we have an idea of    *
*           how large the positional scores have gotten to make this work.    *
*           bug in passed pawn code was evaluating black passed pawns as less *
*           valuable than white.  fixed and passed pawn scores increased      *
*           slightly.  isolated pawn scoring modified so the penalty is pro-  *
*           portional to the number of isolani each side has, rather than the *
*           old approach of penalizing the "excess" isolani one side has over *
*           the other side.  seems to be more accurate, but we'll see.  fixed *
*           a rather gross bug in ValidateMove() related to the way castling  *
*           status not only indicates whether castling is legal or not, but   *
*           if it's not, whether that side castled or move the king/rooks.    *
*           this let ValidateMove() fail to correctly detect that a castling  *
*           move from the hash table might be invalid, which could wreck the  *
*           search easily.  this was an oversight from the new status code.   *
*           serious book bug fixed.  BookUp() was not counting wins and       *
*           losses correctly, a bug introduced to make small.pgn work. minor  *
*           bug in the "trapped bishop" (a2/h2/a7/h7) code fixed.  minor bug  *
*           in Swap() also fixed (early exit that was not safe in rare cases.)*
*                                                                             *
*   11.18   EvaluatePawns() modified to recognize that if there are two white *
*           pawns "rammed" by black pawns at (say) c4/c5 and e4/e5, then any  *
*           pawns on the d-file are also effectively rammed as well since     *
*           there is no hope for advancing it.  auto232 automatic play code   *
*           seems to be working, finally.  the problem was Crafty delayed     *
*           echoing the move back to auto232, if the predicted move was the   *
*           move played by the opponent.  auto232 gave Crafty 3 seconds and   *
*           then said "too late, you must be hung."  outpost knight scoring   *
*           modified to produce scores between 0 and .2 pawns.  a knight was  *
*           getting too valuable, which caused some confusion in the scoring. *
*                                                                             *
*   11.19   slight reduction in the value of passed pawns, as they were       *
*           getting pretty large.  cleaned up annotate.c to get rid of code   *
*           that didn't work out.  annotate now gives the PV for the move     *
*           actually played as well as the move Crafty suggests is best.      *
*           Crafty now has a reasonable "trade" bonus that kicks in when it   *
*           has 20 points of material (or less) and is ahead or behind at     *
*           least 2 pawns.  this trade bonus ranges from 0 to 1000 (one pawn) *
*           and encourages the side that is winning to trade, while the side  *
*           that is losing is encouraged to avoid trades.  more minor tweaks  *
*           for auto232 including trying a delay of 100ms before sending      *
*           a move.  new annotate command gives the option to get more than   *
*           one suggested best move displayed, as well as fixes a few bugs    *
*           in the older code.  fix to bishop + wrong rook pawn code to also  *
*           recognize the RP + no pieces is just as bad if the king can reach *
*           the queening square first.                                        *
*                                                                             *
*   11.20   cleanup to annotate command.  it now won't predict that one side  *
*           will follow a book line that only resulted in losses.  also a     *
*           couple of glitches in annotate where it was possible for a move   *
*           to take an exhorbitant amount of time if the best move was a      *
*           book move, but there were no other possible book moves.  the      *
*           trade bonus now includes trade pawns if behind, but not if ahead  *
*           as well as now considering being ahead or behind only one pawn    *
*           rather than the two pawns used previously in 11.19.               *
*                                                                             *
*   11.21   additional bug fix in annotate command that would fail if there   *
*           was only one legal move to search.  passed pawn values now have   *
*           an added evaluation component based on material on the board, so  *
*           that they become more valuable as material is traded.             *
*                                                                             *
*   11.22   test command modified.  test <filename> [N] (where N is optional  *
*           and defaults to 99) will terminate a test position after N con-   *
*           secutive iterations have had the correct solution.  bug in        *
*           Quiesce() fixed, which would incorrectly prune (or fail to prune) *
*           some captures, due to using "Material" which is computed with     *
*           respect to white-to-move.  this was fixed many versions ago, but  *
*           the fix was somehow lost.  fix to EvaluateDraws that mistakenly   *
*           declared some endings drawn when there were rookpawns on both     *
*           sides of the board, and the king could get in front of one. minor *
*           fix to RepetitionCheck() that was checking one too many entries.  *
*           no harmful effect other than one extra iteration in the loop that *
*           would make "purify/purity" fail as well as slow things down 1% or *
*           so.                                                               *
*                                                                             *
*   11.23   logpath=, bookpath= and tbpath= command line options added to     *
*           direct logs, books and tb files to the indicated path.  these     *
*           only work as command line options, and can't be used in normal    *
*           places since the files are already opened and in use. a bug in    *
*           Evaluate() would call EvaluatePawns() when there were no pawns,   *
*           breaking things on many systems.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*   12.0    rewrite of Input/Output routines.  Crafty no longer relies on the *
*           C library buffered I/O routine scanf() for input.  this made it   *
*           basically impossible to determine when to read data from the key- *
*           board, which made xboard/winboard difficult to interface with.    *
*           now Crafty does its own I/O using read(), which is actually much  *
*           cleaner and easier.  minor bug where a fail high in very short    *
*           time controls might not get played...                             *
*                                                                             *
*   12.1    clean-up of Main().  the code had gotten so obtuse with the       *
*           pondering call, plus handling Option() plus move input, that it   *
*           was nearly impossible to follow.  It is now *much* cleaner and    *
*           easier to understand/follow.                                      *
*                                                                             *
*   12.2    continued cleanup of I/O, particularly the way main() is          *
*           structured, to make it more understandable.  rewritten time.c     *
*           to make it more readable and understandable, not to mention       *
*           easier to modify.  fixed a timing problem where Crafty could be   *
*           pondering, and the predicted move is made followed immediately by *
*           "force", caused when the opponent makes a move and loses on time, *
*           or makes a move and resigns.  this would leave the engine state   *
*           somewhat confused, and would result in the "new" command not      *
*           reinitializing things at all, which would hang crafty on xboard   *
*           or winboard.                                                      *
*                                                                             *
*   12.3    modified piece values somewhat to increase their worth relative   *
*           to a pawn, to try to stop the tendency to sac a piece for 3 pawns *
*           and get into trouble for doing so.  minor fixes in NewGame() that *
*           caused odd problems, such as learning positions after 1. e4.  the *
*           position.lrn/.bin files were growing faster than they should.     *
*           other minor tweaks to fix a few broken commands in Option().      *
*           slight reduction in trade bonus to match slightly less valuable   *
*           pawns.                                                            *
*                                                                             *
*   12.4    added ABSearch() macro, which makes Search() much easier to read  *
*           by doing the test to call Search() or Quiesce() in the macro      *
*           where it is hidden from sight.  bugs in the way the log files     *
*           were closed and then used caused crashed with log=off.            *
*                                                                             *
*   12.5    development bonus for central pawns added to combat the h4/a3     *
*           sort of openings that would get Crafty into trouble.  it now will *
*           try to seize the center if the opponent dallies around.           *
*                                                                             *
*   12.6    bug in EvaluateDraws() that would erroneously decide that a KNP   *
*           vs K was drawn if the pawn was a rook pawn and the king could get *
*           in front of it, which was wrong.  another minor bug would use     *
*           EvaluateMate() when only a simple exchange ahead, which would     *
*           result in sometimes giving up a pawn to reach such a position.    *
*           minor bug in SetBoard() would incorrectly reset many important    *
*           game state variables if the initial position was set to anything  *
*           other than the normal starting position, such as wild 7.  this    *
*           would make learning add odd PV's to the .lrn file.  development   *
*           bonus modified topenalize moving the queen before minor pieces,   *
*           and not moving minor pieces at all.  it is now possible to build  *
*           a "wild 7" book, by first typing "wild 7", and then typing the    *
*           normal book create command.  Crafty will remember to reset to the *
*           "wild 7" position at the start of each book line.  note that it   *
*           is not possible to have both wild 7 book lines *and* regular book *
*           lines in the same book.                                           *
*                                                                             *
*   12.7    failsoft added, so that scores can now be returned outside the    *
*           alpha/beta window.  minor null-move threat detection added where  *
*           a mate in 1 score, returned by a null-move search, causes a one   *
*           ply search extension, since a mate in one is a serious threat.    *
*           razoring is now disabled if there is *any* sort of extension in   *
*           the search preceeding the point where razoring would be applied,  *
*           to avoid razoring taking away one ply from a search that was ex-  *
*           tended (for good reasons) earlier.  fail-soft discarded, due to   *
*           no advantages at all, and a slight slowdown in speed.  rewrite of *
*           pawn hashing, plus a rewrite of the weak pawn scoring code to     *
*           make it significantly more accurate, while going a little slower  *
*           (but since hashing hits 99% of the time, the slower speed is not  *
*           noticable at all.)  evaluation tweaking as well.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   12.8    continued work on weak pawn analysis, as well as a few minor      *
*           changes to clean the code up.                                     *
*                                                                             *
*   13.0    preparation for the Paris WMCCC version starts here.  first new   *
*           thing is the blocked pawn evaluation code.  this recognizes when  *
*           a pawn is immobolized and when a pawn has lever potential, but    *
*           is disabled if playing a computer opponent.  passed pawn scoring  *
*           modified to eliminate duplicate bonuses that were added in        *
*           EvaluatePawns as well as EvaluatePassedPawns.  Trade bonus code   *
*           rewritten to reflect trades made based on the material when the   *
*           search begins.  this means that some things have to be cleared in *
*           the hash table after a capture is really made on the board, but   *
*           prevents the eval from looking so odd near the end of a game.     *
*           minor bug with book random 0 fixed.  if there was only one book   *
*           move, the search could blow up.                                   *
*                                                                             *
*   13.1    all positional scores reduced by 1/4, in an attempt to balance    *
*           things a little better.  also more modifications to the weak and  *
*           blocked pawn code.  added evaluation code to help with KRP vs KR, *
*           so that the pawn won't be advanced too far before the king comes  *
*           to its aid.  ditto for defending, it knows that once the king is  *
*           in front of the pawn, it is a draw.                               *
*                                                                             *
*   13.2    blocked pawn scoring changed slightly to not check too far to see *
*           if a pawn can advance.  also pawns on center squares are weighted *
*           more heavily to encourage keeping them there, or trying to get    *
*           rid of them if the opponent has some there.  discovered that      *
*           somehow, the two lines of code that add in bonuses for passed     *
*           pawns were deleted as I cleaned up and moved code around.  these  *
*           were reinserted (missing from 13.0 on).                           *
*                                                                             *
*   13.3    modified tablebase code to support 5 piece endings.  there is now *
*           a configuration option (see Makefile) to specify 3, 4 or 5 piece  *
*           endgame databases.  more evaluation tuning.                       *
*                                                                             *
*   13.4    modified null-move search.  if there is more than a rook left for *
*           the side on move, null is always tried, as before.  if there is   *
*           a rook or less left, the null move is only tried within 5 plies   *
*           of the leaf positions, so that as the search progresses deeper,   *
*           null-move errors are at least moved away from the root.  many     *
*           evaluation changes, particularly to king safety and evaluating    *
*           castling to one side while the other side is safer.  also it now  *
*           handles pre-castled positions better.                             *
*                                                                             *
*   13.5    "from-to" display patch from Jason added.  this shows the from    *
*           and to squares on a small diagram, oriented to whether Crafty is  *
*           playing black or white.  the intent is to minimize operator       *
*           errors when playing black and the board coordinates are reversed. *
*           more eval changes.                                                *
*                                                                             *
*   13.6    weak pawns on open files now add value to the opponent's rooks    *
*           since they are the pieces that will primarily use an open file to *
*           attack a weak pawn.                                               *
*                                                                             *
*   13.7    minor eval tweaks, plus fixes for the CR/LF file reading problems *
*           in windows NT.                                                    *
*                                                                             *
*   13.8    adjustments to book.c, primarily preventing Crafty from playing   *
*           lines that had very few games in the file, because those are      *
*           often quite weak players.  minor fix to InputMoves() so that a    *
*           move like bxc3 can *never* be interpreted as a bishop move.  a    *
*           bishop move must use an uppercase B, as in Bxc3.  bug in the      *
*           king safety for white only was not checking for open opponent     *
*           files on the king correctly.                                      *
*                                                                             *
*   13.9    minor adjustment to time allocation to allow "operator time" to   *
*           affect time per move.  this is set by "operator <n>" where <n> is *
*           time in seconds per move that should be "reserved" to allow the   *
*           operator some typing/bookkeeping time.  new command "book         *
*           trigger <n>" added so that in tournament mode, when choosing a    *
*           book line, Crafty will revert to book random 0 if the least       *
*           popular move was played fewer times than <n>.  this is an attempt *
*           to avoid trusting narrow book lines too much while still allowing *
*           adequate randomness.  if the least frequently played move in the  *
*           set of book moves was played fewer times than this, then a search *
*           over all the book moves is done.  If the best one doesn't look    *
*           so hot, crafty drops out of book and searches *all* legal moves   *
*           instead.                                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   13.10   minor adjustments.  this is the gold Paris version that is going  *
*           with Jason.  any changes made during the event will be included   *
*           in the next version.                                              *
*                                                                             *
*   14.0    major eval modification to return to centipawn evaluation, rather *
*           then millipawns.  this reduces the resolution, but makes it a lot *
*           easier to understand evaluation changes.  significant eval mods   *
*           regarding king safety and large positional bonuses, where the ad- *
*           vantage is not pretty solid.  note that old book learning will    *
*           not work now, since the evals are wrong.  old position learning   *
*           must be deleted completely.  see the read.me file for details on  *
*           what must be done about book learning results.  new egtb=n option *
*           to replace the older -DTABLEBASES=n Makefile option, so that the  *
*           tablebases can be enabled or disabled without recompiling.        *
*                                                                             *
*   14.1    glitch in EvaluateDevelopment() was producing some grossly large  *
*           positional scores.  also there were problems with where the       *
*           PreEvaluate() procedure were called, so that it could be called   *
*           *after* doing RootMoveslist(), but before starting a search.  this*
*           caused minor problems with hashing scores.  one case was that it  *
*           was possible for a "test suite" to produce slightly different     *
*           scores than the same position run in normal mode.  this has been  *
*           corrected.  st=n command now supports fractional times to .01     *
*           second resolution.                                                *
*                                                                             *
*   14.2    MATE reduced to 32767, which makes all scores now fit into 16     *
*           bits.  added code to EvaluatePawns() to detect the Stonewall      *
*           pawn formation and not like it as black.  also it detects a       *
*           reversed Stonewall formation (for black) and doesn't like it as   *
*           white.  EvaluateOutsidePassedPawns() removed.  functionality is   *
*           incorporated in EvaluatePawns() and is hashed, which speeds the   *
*           evaluation up a bit.  king safety is now fully symmetric and is   *
*           folded into individual piece scoring to encourage pieces to       *
*           attack an unsafe king.                                            *
*                                                                             *
*   14.3    minor adjustments to the king safety code for detecting attacks   *
*           initiated by pushing kingside pawns.  flip/flop commands added to *
*           mirror the board either horizontally or vertically to check for   *
*           symmetry bugs in the evaluation.  other eval tuning changes.      *
*                                                                             *
*   14.4    queen value increased to stop trading queen for two rooks.  book  *
*           learning slightly modified to react quicker.  also scores are now *
*           stored in the book file as floats to get rid of an annoying trun- *
*           cation problem that was dragging scores toward zero.  the book    *
*           file now has a "version" so that old book versions won't cause    *
*           problems due to incorrect formats.  null-move mated threat ex-    *
*           tension was modified.  if null-move search fails high, I fail     *
*           high as always, if it fails low, and it says I get mated in N     *
*           moves, I extend all moves at this ply, since something is going   *
*           on.  I also carry this threat extension into the hash table since *
*           a hash entry can say "don't do null move, it will fail low."  I   *
*           now have a flag that says not only will null-move fail low, it    *
*           fails to "mated in N" so this ply needs extending even without a  *
*           null-move search to tell it so.  book learning greatly modified   *
*           in the way it "distributes" the learned values, in an effort to   *
*           make learning happen faster.  I now construct a sort of "tree"    *
*           so I know how many book alternatives Crafty had at each move it   *
*           at each book move it played.  I then assign the whole learn value *
*           to all moves below the last book move where there was a choice,   *
*           and also assign the whole learn value to the move where there     *
*           was a choice.  I then divide the learn value by the number of     *
*           choices and assign this to each book move (working backward once  *
*           again) until the next point where there were choices.  this makes *
*           sure that if there is a choice, and it is bad, it won't be played *
*           again, even if this choice was at move 2, and the remainder of    *
*           the book line was completely forced.  all in an effort to learn   *
*           more quickly.                                                     *
*                                                                             *
*   14.5    annotate bug fixed where if there was only one legal move, the    *
*           annotation would stop with no warning.  BookUp() now produces a   *
*           more useful error message, giving the exact line number in the    *
*           input file where the error occurred, to make fixing them easier.  *
*           if you are playing without a book.bin, 14.4 would crash in the    *
*           book learning code.  this is now caught and avoided.  BookUp()    *
*           now knows how to skip analysis in PGN files, so you can use such  *
*           files to create your opening book, without having problems.  it   *
*           understands that nesting () {} characters "hides" the stuff in-   *
*           side them, as well as accepting non-standard PGN comments that    *
*           are inside [].  Annotate() now will annotate a PGN file with      *
*           multiple games, although it will use the same options for all of  *
*           the games.  PGN headers are preserved in the .can file.  annotate *
*           now will recognize the first move in a comment (move) or {move}   *
*           and will search that move and give analysis for it in addition to *
*           the normal output.                                                *
*                                                                             *
*   14.6    minor change to book random 4 (use learned value.)  if all the    *
*           learned values are 0, then use the book random 3 option instead.  *
*           bug in 50-move counter fixed.  Learn() could cause this to be set *
*           to a value that didn't really reflect the 50-move status, and     *
*           cause games to be drawn when they should not be.  modified the    *
*           "Mercilous" attack code to recognize a new variation he worked    *
*           out that sacrifices a N, R and B for a mating attack.  no more.   *
*                                                                             *
*   14.7    "verbose" command removed and replaced by a new "display" command *
*           that sets display options.  use "help display" for more info on   *
*           how this works.  the "mercilous" attack scoring is only turned on *
*           when playing "mercilous".  but there is a new "special" list that *
*           you can add players too if you want, and this special scoring is  *
*           turned on for them as well.                                       *
*                                                                             *
*   14.8    new scoring term to penalize unbalanced trades.  IE if Crafty has *
*           to lose a pawn, it would often trade a knight for two pawns in-   *
*           stead, which is actually worse.  this new term prevents this sort *
*           of trades.                                                        *
*                                                                             *
*   14.9    "mercilous" attack code modified to handle a new wrinkle he (and  *
*           one other player) found.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   14.10   new "bench" command runs a test and gives a benchmark comparison  *
*           for crafty and compares this to a P6/200 base machine.  minor bug *
*           disabled the "dynamic draw score" and fixed it at zero, even if   *
*           the opponent was much weaker (rating) or behind on time.  also    *
*           draw_score was not reset to 0 at start of each new game, possibly *
*           leaving it at +.20 after playing a higher-rated opponent.         *
*                                                                             *
*   14.11   release to make mercilous attack detection code the default, to   *
*           prevent the rash of mercilous attacks on the chess servers.       *
*                                                                             *
*   14.12   modified tuning of evaluation.  scores were reduced in the past,  *
*           to discourage the piece for two pawns sort of trades, but since   *
*           this was basically solved in 14.8, scores are going "back up".    *
*           particularly passed pawn scores.  Crafty now accepts draw offers  *
*           if the last search result was <= the current result returned by   *
*           DrawScore().  it also honors draw requests via xboard when        *
*           against a human opponent as well, and will flag the game as over. *
*           minor modification to annotate.c to display move numbers in the   *
*           PV's to match the PV output format used everywhere else in        *
*           Crafty.  a new type of learning, based on results, has been added *
*           and is optional (learn=7 now enables every type of learning.)     *
*           this type of learning uses the win/lose game result to flag an    *
*           opening that leads to a lost game as "never" play again.  the     *
*           book move selection logic has been modified.  there are four com- *
*           ponents used in choosing book moves:  frequency of play; win/lose *
*           ratio; static evaluation; and learned score.  There are four      *
*           weights that can be modified with the bookw command, that control *
*           how these 4 values are used to choose book moves.  each weight is *
*           a floating point value between 0 and 1, and controls how much the *
*           corresponding term factors in to move selection.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   14.13   fixed a book parsing bug that now requires a [Site "xxx"] tag in  *
*           any book file between lines for the "minplay" option of book      *
*           create to work properly.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   15.0    this is the first version to support a parallel search using      *
*           multiple processors on a shared-memory machinel.  this version    *
*           uses the "PVS" algorithm (Principal Variation Search) that is an  *
*           early form of "Young Brothers Wait".  this is not the final       *
*           search algorithm that will be used, but it is relatively easy to  *
*           implement, so that the massive data structure changes can be de-  *
*           bugged before getting too fancy.  the major performance problem   *
*           with this approach is that all processors work together at a node *
*           and when one finishes, it has to wait until all others finish     *
*           before it can start doing anything more.  this adds up to a       *
*           significant amount of time and really prevents good speedups on   *
*           multiprocessor machines.  this restriction will be eliminanted in *
*           future versions, but it makes debugging much simpler for the      *
*           first version.  after much agonizing, I finally chose to write my *
*           own "spinlock" macros to avoid using the pthread_mutex_lock stuff *
*           that is terribly inefficient due to its trying to be cute and     *
*           yield the processor rather than spinning, when the lock is al-    *
*           ready set.  I'd rather spin than context-switch.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   15.1    this version actually unleashes the full design of the parallel   *
*           search, which lets threads split away from the "pack" when        *
*           they become idle, and they may then jump in and help another      *
*           busy thread.  this eliminates the significant delays that         *
*           occur near the end of a search at a given ply.  now as those pro- *
*           cessors drop out of the search at that ply, they are reused at    *
*           other locations in the tree without any significant delays.       *
*                                                                             *
*   15.2    WinNT support added.  also fixed a small bug in Interrupt() that  *
*           could let it exit with "busy" set so that it would ignore all     *
*           input from that point forward, hanging the game up.  added a new  *
*           "draw accept" and "draw decline" option to enable/disable Crafty  *
*           accepting draw offers if it is even or behind.  turned on by      *
*           an IM/GM opponent automatically.  Thread pools now being used to  *
*           avoid the overhead of creating/destroying threads at a high rate  *
*           rate of speed.  it is now quite easy to keep N processors busy.   *
*                                                                             *
*   15.3    CPU time accounting modified to correctly measure the actual time *
*           spent in a parallel search, as well as to modify the way Crafty   *
*           handles time management in an SMP environment.  a couple of bugs  *
*           fixed in book.c, affecting which moves were played.  also veri-   *
*           fied that this version will play any ! move in books.bin, even if *
*           it was not played in the games used to build the main book.bin    *
*           file.                                                             *
*                                                                             *
*   15.4    this version will terminate threads once the root position is in  *
*           a database, to avoid burning cpu cycles that are not useful. a    *
*           flag "done" is part of each thread block now.  when a thread goes *
*           to select another move to search, and there are no more left, it  *
*           sets "done" in the parent task thread block so that no other pro- *
*           cessors will attempt to "join the party" at that block since no   *
*           work remains to be done.  book selection logic modified so that   *
*           frequency data is "squared" to improve probabilities.  also, the  *
*           frequency data is used to cull moves, in that if a move was not   *
*           played 1/10th of the number of times that the "most popular" move *
*           was played, then that move is eliminated from consideration.      *
*                                                                             *
*   15.5    changes to "volatile" variables to enhance compiler optimization  *
*           in places where it is safe.  added a function ThreadStop() that   *
*           works better at stopping threads when a fail high condition       *
*           occurs at any nodes.  it always stopped all sibling threads at    *
*           the node in question, but failed to stop threads that might be    *
*           working somewhere below the fail-high node.  ThreadStop() will    *
*           recursively call itself to stop all of those threads. significant *
*           increase in king centralization (endgame) scoring to encourage    *
*           the king to come out and fight rather than stay back and get      *
*           squeezed to death.  minor change to queen/king tropism to only    *
*           conside the file distance, not ranks also.  bug in interupt.c     *
*           fixed.  this bug would, on very rare occasion, let crafty read in *
*           a move, but another thread could read on top of this and lose the *
*           move.  xboard would then watch the game end with a <flag>.        *
*                                                                             *
*   15.6    ugly repetition draw bug (SMP only) fixed.  I carefully copied    *
*           the repetition list from parent to child, but also copied the     *
*           repetition list pointer...  which remained pointing at the parent *
*           repetition list.  which failed, of course.                        *
*                                                                             *
*   15.7    problem in passing PV's back up the search fixed.  the old bug of *
*           a fail high/fail low was not completely handled, so that if the   *
*           *last* move on a search failed high, then low, the PV could be    *
*           broken or wrong, causing Crafty to make the wrong move, or else   *
*           break something when the bogus PV was used.  piece/square tables  *
*           now only have the _w version initialized in data.c, to eliminate  *
*           the second copy which often caused errors.  Initialize() now will *
*           copy the _w tables to the _b tables (reflected of course.)        *
*                                                                             *
*   15.8    trade bonus modified to not kick in until one side is two pawns   *
*           ahead or behind, so that trading toward a draw is not so common.  *
*           fixed a whisper bug that would cause Crafty to whisper nonsense   *
*           if it left book, then got back in book.  it also now whispers the *
*           book move it played, rather than the move it would play if the    *
*           opponent played the expected book move, which was confusing.      *
*                                                                             *
*   15.9    bug in positions with one legal move would abort the search after *
*           a 4 ply search, as it should, but it was possible that the result *
*           from the aborted search could be "kept" which would often make    *
*           Crafty just "sit and wait" and flag on a chess server.            *
*                                                                             *
*   15.10   fixed "draw" command to reject draw offers if opponent has < ten  *
*           seconds left and no increment is being used.  fixed glitch in     *
*           LearnResult() that would crash crafty if no book was being used,  *
*           and it decides to resign.  modified trade bonus code to eliminate *
*           a hashing inconsistency.  minor glitch in "show thinking" would   *
*           show bad value if score was mate.  added Tim Mann's new xboard/   *
*           winboard "result" command and modified the output from Crafty to  *
*           tell xboard when a game is over, using the new result format that *
*           Tim now expects.  note that this is xboard 3.6.9, and earlier     *
*           versions will *not* work correctly (ok on servers, but not when   *
*           you play yourself) as the game won't end correctly due to the     *
*           change in game-end message format between the engine and xboard.  *
*                                                                             *
*   15.11   modified SMP code to not start a parallel search at a node until  *
*           "N" (N=2 at present) moves have been search.  N was 1, and when   *
*           move ordering breaks down the size of the tree gets larger.  this *
*           controls that much better.  fixed an ugly learning bug.  if the   *
*           last move actually in the game history was legal for the other    *
*           side, after playing it for the correct side, it could be played   *
*           a second time, which would break things after learning was done.  *
*           an example was Rxd4 for white, where black can respond with Rxd4. *
*           changes for the new 3.6.10 xboard/winboard are also included as   *
*           well as a fix to get book moves displayed in analysis window as   *
*           it used to be done.                                               *
*                                                                             *
*   15.12   "the" SMP repetition bug was finally found and fixed.  CopyToSMP  *
*           was setting the thread-specific rephead_* variable *wrong* which  *
*           broke so many things it was not funny.  evaluation tuning in this *
*           version as well to try to "center" values in a range of -X to +X  *
*           rather than 0 to 2X.  trade bonus had a bug in the pawn part that *
*           not only encouraged trading pawns when it should be doing the     *
*           opposite, but the way it was written actually made it look bad to *
*           win a pawn.  more minor xboard/winboard compatibility bugs fixed  *
*           so that games end when they should.  DrawScore() had a quirk that *
*           caused some problems, in that it didn't know what to do with non- *
*           zero draw scores, and could return a value with the wrong sign at *
*           times.  it is now passed a flag, "crafty_is_white" to fix this.   *
*           modification so that crafty can handle the "FEN" PGN tag and set  *
*           the board to the correct position when it is found.  xboard       *
*           options "hard" and "easy" now enable and disable pondering.       *
*                                                                             *
*   15.13   modification to "bad trade" code to avoid any sort of unbalanced  *
*           trades, like knight/bishop for 2-3 pawns, or two pieces for a     *
*           rook and pawn.  more new xboard/winboard fixes for Illegal move   *
*           messages and other engine interface changes made recently.  minor *
*           change to null move search, to always search with the alpha/beta  *
*           window of (beta-1,beta) rather than (alpha,beta), which is very   *
*           slightly more efficient.                                          *
*                                                                             *
*   15.14   rewrite of ReadPGN() to correctly handle nesting of various sorts *
*           of comments.  this will now correctly parse wall.pgn, except for  *
*           promotion moves with no promotion piece specified.  the book      *
*           create code also now correctly reports when you run out of disk   *
*           space and this should work under any system to let you know when  *
*           you run out of space.                                             *
*                                                                             *
*   15.15   major modifications to Book() and BookUp().  BookUp() now needs   *
*           1/2 the temp space to build a book that it used to need (even     *
*           less under windows).  also, a book position is now 16 bytes in-   *
*           stead of 20 (or 24 under windows) further reducing the space      *
*           requirements.  the "win/lose/draw" counts are no longer absolute, *
*           rather they are relative so they can be stored in one byte. A new *
*           method for setting "!" moves in books.bin is included in this     *
*           version.  for any move in the input file used to make books.bin,  *
*           you can add a {play nn%} string, which says to play this move nn% *
*           of the time, regardless of how frequently it was played in the    *
*           big book file.  for example, e4 {play 50%} says to play e4 50% of *
*           the time.  note two things here:  (1) if the percentages for all  *
*           of white's first moves add up to a number > 100, then the         *
*           percentage played is taken as is, but all will be treated as if   *
*           they sum to 100 (ie if there are three first moves, each with a   *
*           percentage of 50%, they will behave as though they are all 33%    *
*           moves).  (2) for any moves not marked with a % (assuming at least *
*           one move *is* marked with a percent) then such moves will use the *
*           remaining percentage left over applied to them equally. note that *
*           using the % *and* the ! flags together slightly changes things,   *
*           because normally only the set of ! moves will be considered, and  *
*           within that set, any with % specified will have that percent used *
*           as expected.  but if you have some moves with !, then a percent   *
*           on any of the *other* moves won't do a thing, because only the !  *
*           moves will be included in the set to choose from.                 *
*                                                                             *
*   15.16   bug in the king tropism code, particularly for white pieces that  *
*           want to be close to the black king, fixed in this version.  new   *
*           History() function that handles all history/killer cases, rather  *
*           than the old 2-function approach.  ugly RepetitionCheck() bug     *
*           fixed in CopyToSMP().  this was not copying the complete replist  *
*           due to a ply>>2 rather than ply>>1 counter.                       *
*                                                                             *
*   15.17   adjustments to "aggressiveness" to slightly tone it down.  minor  *
*           fix to avoid the odd case of whispering one move and playing an-  *
*           other, caused by a fail-high/fail-low overwriting the pv[1] stuff *
*           and then Iterate() printing that rather than pv[0] which is the   *
*           correct one.  new LegalMove() function that strengthens the test  *
*           for legality at the root, so that it is impossible to ponder a    *
*           move that looks legal, but isn't.  modifications to king safety   *
*           to better handle half-open files around the king as well as open  *
*           files.  EGTB "swindler" added.  if the position is drawn at the   *
*           root of the tree, then all losing moves are excluded from the     *
*           move list and the remainder are searched normally with the EGTB   *
*           databases disabled, in an effort to give the opponent a chance to *
*           go wrong and lose.  fixed "mode tournament" and "book random 0"   *
*           so that they will work correctly with xboard/winboard, and can    *
*           even be used to play bullet games on a server if desired. minor   *
*           fix to attempt to work around a non-standard I/O problem on the   *
*           Macintosh platform dealing with '\r' as a record terminator       *
*           rather than the industry/POSIX-standard \n terminator character.  *
*                                                                             *
*   15.18   fix to the "material balance" evaluation term so that it will not *
*           like two pieces for a rook (plus pawn) nor will it like trading a *
*           piece for multiple pawns.  a rather gross bug in the repetition   *
*           code (dealing with 50 move rule) could overwrite random places in *
*           memory when the 50 move rule approached, because the arrays were  *
*           not long enough to hold 50 moves, plus allow the search to go     *
*           beyond the 50-move rule (which is legal and optional) and then    *
*           output moves (which uses ply=65 data structures).  this let the   *
*           repetition (50-move-rule part) overwrite things by storing well   *
*           beyond the end of the repetition list for either side.  minor fix *
*           to EGTB "swindle" code.  it now only tries the searches if it is  *
*           the side with swindling chances.  ie it is pointless to try for   *
*           a swindle in KRP vs KR if you don't have the P.  :)  some very    *
*           substantial changes to evaluate.c to get things back into some    *
*           form of synch with each other.                                    *
*                                                                             *
*   15.19   more evaluation changes.  slight change to the Lock() facility    *
*           as it is used to lock the hash table.  modifications to the book  *
*           selection logic so that any move in books.bin that is not in the  *
*           regular book.bin file still can be played, and will be played if  *
*           it has a {play xxx%} or ! option.  new option added to the book   *
*           create command to allow the creation of a better book.  this      *
*           option lets you specify a percentage that says "exclude a book    *
*           move it if didn't win xx% as many games as it lost.  IE, if the   *
*           book move has 100 losses, and you use 50% for the new option, the *
*           move will only be included if there are at least 50 wins.  this   *
*           allows culling lines that only lost, for example.  new bad trade  *
*           scoring that is simpler.  if one side has one extra minor piece   *
*           and major pieces are equal, the other side has traded a minor for *
*           pawns and made a mistake.  if major pieces are not matched, and   *
*           one side has two or more extra minors, we have seen either a rook *
*           for two minor pieces (bad) or a queen for three minor pieces (bad *
*           also).  horrible bug in initializing min_thread_depth, which is   *
*           supposed to control thrashing.  the SMP search won't split the    *
*           tree within "min_thread_depth" of the leaf positions.  due to a   *
*           gross bug, however, this was initialized to "2", and would have   *
*           been the right value except that a ply in Crafty is 60.  the      *
*           mtmin command that adjusts this correctly multiplied it by 60,    *
*           but in data.c, it was left at "2" which lets the search split way *
*           too deeply and can cause thrashing.  it now correctly defaults to *
*           120 (2*INCPLY) as planned.  Crafty now *only* supports     *
*           winboard/xboard 4.0 or higher, by sending the string "move xxx"   *
*           to indicate its move.  this was done to eliminate older xboard    *
*           versions that had some incompatibilities with crafty that were    *
*           causing lots of questions/problems.  xboard 4.0 works perfectly   *
*           and is the only recommended GUI now.                              *
*                                                                             *
*   15.20   new evaluation term to ensure that pawns are put on squares of    *
*           the opposite color as the bishop in endings where one side only   *
*           has a single bishop.  another new evaluation term to favor        *
*           bishops over knights in endings with pawns on both sides of the   *
*           board.  search extensions now constrained so that when doing an   *
*           N-ply search, the first 2N plies can extend normally, but beyond  *
*           that the extensions are reduced by one-half.  this eliminates a   *
*           few tree explosions that wasted lots of time but didn't produce   *
*           any useful results.  this version solves 299/300 of the Win at    *
*           Chess positions on a single-cpu pentium pro 200mhz machine now.   *
*           new evaluation term to reward "pawn duos" (two pawns side by side *
*           which gives them the most flexibility in advancing.  a change to  *
*           the bishops of opposite color to not just consider B vs B drawish *
*           when the B's are on opposite colors, but to also consider other   *
*           positons like RB vs RB drawish with opposite B's.                 *
*                                                                             *
*   16.0    hash functions renamed to HashProbe() and HashStore().  The store *
*           functions (2) were combined to eliminate some duplicate code and  *
*           shrink the cache footprint a bit.  adjustment to "losing the      *
*           right to castle" so that the penalty is much less if this is done *
*           when trading queens, since a king in the center becomes less of a *
*           problem there. several eval tweaks.  support for Eugene Nalimov's *
*           new endgame databases that reduce the size by 50%.  added a new   *
*           cache=xxx command to set the tablebase cache (more memory means   *
*           less I/O of course).  the "egtb" command now has two uses.  if    *
*           use egtb=0, you can disable tablebases for testing.  otherwise,   *
*           you just add "egtb" to your command line or .craftyrc file and    *
*           Crafty automatically recognizes the files that are present and    *
*           sets up to probe them properly. added an eval term to catch a     *
*           closed position with pawns at e4/d3/c4 and then avoiding the      *
*           temptation to castle into an attack.  most of the evaluation      *
*           discontinuities have been removed, using the two new macros       *
*           ScaleToMaterial() and InverseScaleToMaterial().  Scale() is used  *
*           to reduce scores as material is removed from the board, while     *
*           InverseScale() is used to increase the score as material is       *
*           removed.  this removed a few ugly effects of things happening     *
*           right around the EG_MAT threshold.                                *
*                                                                             *
*   16.1    bug in EGTBProbe() which used the wrong variable to access the    *
*           enpassant target square was fixed.  the cache=x command now       *
*           checks for a failed malloc() and reverts to the default cache     *
*           size to avoid crashes.  major eval tuning changes.  cache bug     *
*           would do an extra malloc() and if it is done after the "egtb"     *
*           command it would crash.  analyze mode now turns off the "swindle" *
*           mode.                                                             *
*                                                                             *
*   16.2    more evaluation changes, specifically to bring king safety down   *
*           to reasonable levels.  support for the DGT electronic chess board *
*           is now included (but only works in text mode, not in conjunction  *
*           with xboard/winboard yet.  fix to HashStore() that corrected a    *
*           problem with moving an entry from tablea to tableb, but to the    *
*           wrong address 50% of the time (thanks to J. Wesley Cleveland).    *
*                                                                             *
*   16.3    performance tweaks plus a few evaluation changes.  An oversight   *
*           would let crafty play a move like exd5 when cxd5 was playable.    *
*           IE it didn't follow the general rule "capture toward the center." *
*           this has been fixed.  king safety ramped up just a bit.           *
*                                                                             *
*   16.4    search extension fixed.  one-reply was being triggered when there *
*           was only one capture to look at as well, which was wrong.  minor  *
*           fix to king safety in Evaluate().  adjustments to preeval to fix  *
*           some "space" problems caused by not wanting to advance pawns at   *
*           all, plus some piece/square pawn values that were too large near  *
*           the opponent's king position.  new swindle on|off command allows  *
*           the user to disable "swindle mode" so that crafty will report     *
*           tablebase draws as draws.  swindle mode is now disabled auto-     *
*           matically in analysis or annotate modes.  DrawScore() now returns *
*           a draw score that is not nearly so negative when playing humans.  *
*           the score was a bit large (-.66 and -.33) so that this could tend *
*           to force Crafty into losing rather than drawn positions at times. *
*           EGTB probe code now monitors how the probes are affecting the nps *
*           and modifies the probe depth to control this.  IE it adjusts the  *
*           max depth of probes to attempt to keep the NPS at around 50% or   *
*           thereabouts of the nominal NPS rate.  fixed a nasty bug in the    *
*           EGTB 'throttle' code.  it was possible that the EGTB_mindepth     *
*           could get set to something more than 4 plies, then the next       *
*           search starts off already in a tablebase ending, but with this    *
*           probe limit, it wouldn't probe yet Iterate() would terminate the  *
*           search after a couple of plies.  and the move chosen could draw.  *
*           new code submitted by George Barrett, which adds a new command    *
*           "html on".  Using this will cause the annotate command to produce *
*           a game.html file (rather than game.can) which includes nice board *
*           displays (bitmapped images) everywhere Crafty suggests a different*
*           move.  you will need to download the bitmaps directory files to   *
*           make this work.  note that html on enables this or you will get   *
*           normal annotation output in the .can file.  final hashing changes *
*           made.  now crafty has only two hash tables, the 'depth preferred' *
*           and 'always store' tables, but not one for each side.             *
*                                                                             *
*   16.5    minor glitch in internal iterative deepening code (in search.c)   *
*           could sometimes produce an invalid move.  crafty now probes the   *
*           hash table to find the best move which works in all cases.        *
*           interesting tablebase bug fixed.  By probing at ply=2, the        *
*           search could overlook a repetition/50 move draw, and turn a won   *
*           position into a draw.  Crafty now only probes at ply > 2, to      *
*           let the RepetitionCheck() function have a chance.  added code by  *
*           Dan Corbett to add environment variables for the tablebases,      *
*           books, logfiles and the .craftyrc file paths.  the environment    *
*           variables CRAFTY_TB_PATH, CRAFTY_BOOK_PATH, CRAFTY_LOG_PATH and   *
*           CRAFTY_RC_PATH should point to where these files are located and  *
*           offer an alternative to specifying them on the command line.      *
*           final version of the EGTB code is included in this version.  this *
*           allows Crafty to use either compressed (using Andrew Kadatch's    *
*           compressor, _not_ zip or gzip) or non-compressed tablebases.  it  *
*           will use non-compressed files when available, and will also use   *
*           compressed files that are available so long as there is no non-   *
*           compressed version of the same file.  it is allowable to mix and  *
*           match as you see fit, but with all of the files compressed, the   *
*           savings is tremendous, roughly a factor of 5 in space reduction.  *
*                                                                             *
*   16.6    major rewrite of king-safety pawn shelter code to emphasize open  *
*           files (and half-open files) moreso than just pawns that have been *
*           moved.  dynamic EGTB probe depth removed.  this caused far too    *
*           many search inconsistencies.  a fairly serious SMP bug that could *
*           produce a few hash glitches was found.  rewrite of the 'king-     *
*           tropism' code completed.  now the pieces that are 'crowding' the  *
*           king get a bigger bonus if there are more of them.  ie it is more *
*           than twice as good if we have two pieces close to the king, while *
*           before this was purely 'linear'.  minor fix to book.c to cure an  *
*           annotate command bug that would produce odd output in multi-game  *
*           PGN files.                                                        *
*                                                                             *
*   16.7    minor bug in 'book create' command would produce wrong line num-  *
*           bers if you used two book create commands without restarting      *
*           crafty between uses.  replaced "ls" command with a !cmd shell     *
*           escape to allow _any_ command to be executed by a shell. change   *
*           to bishop scoring to avoid a bonus for a bishop pair _and_ a good *
*           bishop sitting at g2/g7/etc to fill a pawn hole.  if the bishop   *
*           fills that hole, the bishop pair score is reduced by 1/2 to avoid *
*           scores getting too large.  another ugly SMP bug fixed.  it was    *
*           for the CopyFromSMP() function to fail because Search() put the   *
*           _wrong_ value into tree->value.  the "don't castle into an unsafe *
*           king position" code was scaled up a bit as it wasn't quite up to  *
*           detecting all cases of this problem.  the parallel search has     *
*           been modified so that it can now split the tree at the root, as   *
*           well as at deeper nodes.  this has improved the parallel search   *
*           efficiency noticably while also making the code a bit more        *
*           complex.  this uses an an adaptive algorithm that pays close      *
*           attention to the node count for each root move.  if one (or more) *
*           moves below the best move have high node counts (indicating that  *
*           these moves might become new 'best' moves) then these moves are   *
*           flagged as "don't search in parallel" so that all such moves are  *
*           searched one by one, using all processors so that a new best move *
*           if found faster.  positional scores were scaled back 50% and the  *
*           king safety code was again modified to incorporate pawn storms,   *
*           which was intentionally ignored in the last major revision.  many *
*           other scoring terms have been modified as well to attempt to      *
*           bring the scores back closer to something reasonable.             *
*                                                                             *
*   16.8    bug in evaluate.c (improper editing) broke the scoring for white  *
*           rooks on open files (among other things.)  new twist on null-     *
*           move search...  Crafty now uses R=3 near the root of the tree,    *
*           and R=2 near the top.  it also uses null-move so long as there is *
*           a single piece on the board, but when material drops to a rook or *
*           less, null move is turned off and only used in the last 7 plies   *
*           to push the zugzwang errors far enough off that they can be       *
*           avoided, hopefully.                                               *
*                                                                             *
*   16.9    tuning to king safety.  King in center of board was way too high  *
*           which made the bonus for castling way too big.  more fine-tuning  *
*           on the new 'tropism' code (that tries to coordinate piece attacks *
*           on the king).  it understands closeness and (now) open files for  *
*           the rooks/queens.  modified blocked center pawn code so that an   *
*           'outpost' in front of an unmoved D/E pawn is made even stronger   *
*           since it restrains that pawn and cramps the opponent.             *
*                                                                             *
*   16.10   all scores are back to 16.6 values except for king safety, as     *
*           these values played well.  king safety is quite a bit different   *
*           and now has two fine-tuning paramaters that can be set in the     *
*           crafty.rc file (try help ksafety for more details, or see the new *
*           crafty.doc for more details.  suffice it to say that you can now  *
*           tune it to be aggressive or passive as you wish.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   16.11   adjustment to king safety asymmetry to make Crafty a bit more     *
*           cautious about starting a king-side attack.  new "ksafe tropism"  *
*           command allows the tropism scores (pulling pieces toward opponent *
*           king) to be adjusted up or down (up is more aggressive).          *
*                                                                             *
*   16.12   evaluation adjustment options changed.  the new command to modify *
*           this stuff is "evaluation option value".  For example, to change  *
*           the asymmetry scoring for king safety, you now use "evaluation    *
*           asymmetry 120".  see "help evaluation" for more details.  There   *
*           is a new "bscale" option to adjust the scores for 'blocked' type  *
*           positions, and I added a new "blockers_list" so that players that *
*           continually try to lock things up to get easy draws can be better *
*           handled automatically.  The command is "list B +name".  there are *
*           other adjustable evaluation scaling parameters now (again, use    *
*           "help evaluation" to see the options.)                            *
*                                                                             *
*   16.13   bug in Evaluate() fixed.  king safety could produce impossibly    *
*           large scores due to negative subscript values.  minor change to   *
*           root.c to allow partial tablebase sets while avoiding the ugly    *
*           potential draw problem.  this was supplied by Tim Hoooebeek and   *
*           seems to work ok for those wanting to have files like kpk with-   *
*           out the corresponding promotion files.                            *
*                                                                             *
*   16.14   bug in Evaluate() fixed.  king safety could produce impossibly    *
*           large scores due to a subscript two (2) larger than expected for  *
*           max values.  A couple of other minor tweaks to rook on 7th as     *
*           well.  setboard now validates enpassant target square to be sure  *
*           that an enpassant capture is physically possible, and that the    *
*           target square is on the right rank with pawns in the right place. *
*                                                                             *
*   16.15   bug in EGTBProbe() usage fixed.  it was possible to call this     *
*           function before tablebases were initialized, or when there were   *
*           more than 3 pieces on one side, which would break a subscript.    *
*                                                                             *
*   16.16   changes to the way EvaluatePassedPawn() works.  it now does a     *
*           reasonable job of penalizing blockaded passed pawns.  also a bug  *
*           in king scoring used a variable set from the previous call to the *
*           Evaluate() procedure, which could produce bizarre effects.  a few *
*           minor eval glitches that caused asymmetric scores unintentionally *
*           were removed.                                                     *
*                                                                             *
*   16.17   minor "hole" in SMP code fixed.  it was possible that a move      *
*           displayed as the best in SearchOutput() would not get played.     *
*           very subtle timing issue dealing with the search timing out and   *
*           forgetting to copy the best move back to the right data area.     *
*           minor fixes to the modified -USE_ATTACK_FUNCTIONS option that     *
*           was broken when the And()/Or()/ShiftX() macros were replaced by   *
*           their direct bitwise operator replacements.                       *
*                                                                             *
*   16.18   adjustments to king tropism scoring terms (these attract pieces   *
*           toward the opponent king in a coordinated way).  the scoring term *
*           that kept the queen from going to the opposite side of the board  *
*           was not working well which would also cause attacking problems.   *
*           razoring code has been disabled, as it neither helps or hurts on  *
*           tactical tests, and it creates a few hashing problems that are    *
*           annoying.  bug in HashStorePV() that would store the PV into the  *
*           hash table, but possibly in the wrong table entry, which could    *
*           stuff a bad move in a hash entry, or overwrite a key entry that   *
*           could have been useful later.  book random 0 was slightly wrong   *
*           as it could not ignore book moves if the search said that the     *
*           score was bad.  also the search would not time-out properly on a  *
*           forced move, it would use the entire time alotted which was a big *
*           waste of time when there was only one legal move to make. a very  *
*           interesting bug was found in storing mate bounds in the hash      *
*           table, one I had not heard of before.  I now store two MATE       *
*           bounds, either > MATE-300, or < -MATE+300, which is conservative  *
*           but safe.  Another change to Iterate() to make it avoid exiting   *
*           as soon as a mate is found, so that it can find the shortest mate *
*           possible.                                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   16.19   savepos now pads each rank to 8 characters so that programs that  *
*           don't handle abbreviated FEN will be able to parse Crafty's FEN   *
*           output without problems.  threads are no longer started and       *
*           stopped before after searches that seem to not need multiple      *
*           threads (such as when the starting position is in the databases   *
*           or whatever) because in fast games, it can start and stop them    *
*           after each search, due to puzzling for a ponder move, and this is *
*           simply to inefficient to deal with, and burning the extra cpus is *
*           only bad if the machine is used for other purposes.  and when the *
*           machine is not dedicated to chess only, the SMP search is very    *
*           poor anyway.  new lockless hashing (written by Tim Mann) added    *
*           to improve SMP performance.  new eval term that handles various   *
*           types of candidate passed pawns, most commonly the result of a    *
*           position where one side has an offside majority that later turns  *
*           into an outside passed pawn.  new EGTBPV() procedure added.  this *
*           code will print the entire PV of a tablebase mating line.  if it  *
*           given an option of ! (command is "egtb !") it will add a ! to any *
*           move where there is only one optimal choice.  Crafty will now     *
*           automatically display the EGTB PV if you give it a setboard FEN   *
*           command, or if you just give it a raw FEN string (the setboard    *
*           command is now optional except in test suites).  this version now *
*           supports the 6 piece database files.  to include this support,    *
*           you need to -DEGTB6 when compiling everything.  the majority code *
*           has been temporarily removed so that this version can be released *
*           to get the 6 piece ending stuff out.                              *
*                                                                             *
*   17.0    connected passed pawn scoring modified so that connected passers  *
*           don't get any sort of bonus, except for those cases where the     *
*           opponent has a rook or more.  this will avoid liking positions    *
*           where crafty has two connected passers on the d/e files, and the  *
*           opponent has passers on the b/g files.  the split passers win if  *
*           all pieces are traded, while the connected passers are better     *
*           when pieces are present.  a new scoring term evaluates the        *
*           "split" passers similar to outside passers, this at the request   *
*           (make that demand) of GM Roman Dzindzichashvili. Book() now finds *
*           the most popular move as the move to ponder.  this eliminated all *
*           'puzzling' searches which result in clearing the hash tables two  *
*           times for every book move, which can slow it down when a large    *
*           hash table is used.  new book option for playing against computer *
*           opponents was written for this version.  Crafty now supports two  *
*           "books.bin" type files, books.bin and bookc.bin (the bookc create *
*           command can be used to make bookc.bin).  bookc will only be used  *
*           when crafty is playing a computer.  this is supplied by xboard or *
*           winboard when playing on a server, or can be included int the     *
*           crafty.rc/.craftyrc file when playing directly.  bookc.bin will   *
*           be used when playing a computer only, and should be used to avoid *
*           unsound lines that are fine against humans, but not against other *
*           computers.  if you don't use a bookc.bin, it will use the normal  *
*           books.bin as always.  if you use both, it will only use bookc.bin *
*           in games that have been started and then given the 'computer'     *
*           command.  minor adjustment to EGTB probe code so that it will     *
*           always probe TBs at ply=2 (if the right number of pieces are on   *
*           the board) but won't probe beyond ply=2 unless the move at the    *
*           previous ply was a capture/promotion and the total pieces drops   *
*           into the proper range for TB probes.  this makes the 6 piece      *
*           files far more efficient as before it would continuously probe    *
*           after reaching 6 piece endings, even if it didn't have the right  *
*           file.  Now after the capture that takes us to a 6 piece ending    *
*           we probe one time...  and if there is no hit we don't probe at    *
*           the next node (or any successors) unless there is another capture *
*           or promotion that might take us to a database we have.  the book  *
*           (binary) format has once again been modified, meaning that to use *
*           16.20 and beyond the book.bin/books.bin files must be re-built    *
*           from the raw PGN input.  this new format includes an entry for    *
*           the CAP project score, so that deep searches can be used to guide *
*           opening book lines.  a new weight (bookw CAP) controls how much   *
*           this affects book move ordering/selection.  a new import command  *
*           will take the raw CAPS data and merge it into the book.bin after  *
*           the file has been built.  serious bug in SetBoard() would leave   *
*           old EP status set in test suites.  this has been fixed.  outpost  *
*           knight code was modified so that a knight in a hole is good, a    *
*           knight in a hole supported by a pawn is better, supported by two  *
*           pawns is still better, and if the opponent has no knights or a    *
*           bishop that can attack this knight it is even better.  the out-   *
*           post bonus for a bishop was removed.  a pretty serious parallel   *
*           search bug surfaced.  in non-parallel searches, Crafty _always_   *
*           completed the current ply=1 move after the time limit is reached, *
*           just to be sure that this move isn't going to become a new best   *
*           move.  however, when parallel searching, this was broken, and at  *
*           the moment time runs out, the search would be stopped if the      *
*           parallel split was done at the root of the tree, which means that *
*           where the search would normally find a new best move, it would    *
*           not.  this has been fixed.  new "store <val>" command can be used *
*           to make "position learning" remember the current position and the *
*           score (val) you supply.  this is useful in analyze mode to move   *
*           into the game, then let crafty know that the current position is  *
*           either lost or won (with a specific score).                       *
*                                                                             *
*   17.1    book structure fixed, since compilers can't quite agree on how    *
*           structures ought to be aligned, for reasons not clear to me.  a   *
*           serious eval bug that could produce gross scores when one side    *
*           had two queens was fixed.                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   17.2    isolated pawn scoring tweaked a bit, plus a couple of bugs in the *
*           way EvaluateDevelopment() was called were fixed.                  *
*                                                                             *
*   17.3    passed pawn scores increased somewhat to improve endgame play.    *
*                                                                             *
*   17.4    minor bug with "black" command (extra line from unknown origin)   *
*           would make "black" command fail to do anything.  minor tweaks to  *
*           passed pawn scoring again...  and a slight performance improve-   *
*           ment in how EvaluateKingSafety() is called.  code for "bk"        *
*           from xboard was somehow lost.  it now provides a book hint.       *
*                                                                             *
*   17.4    minor bug with "black" command (extra line from unknown origin)   *
*           would make "black" command fail to do anything.  minor tweaks to  *
*           passed pawn scoring again...  and a slight performance improve-   *
*                                                                             *
*   17.5    rewrite of outside passed pawn/pawn majority code.  it is now     *
*           much faster by using pre-computed bitmaps to recognize the right  *
*           patterns.                                                         *
*                                                                             *
*   17.6    minor fix in interupt.c, which screwed up handling some commands  *
*           while pondering.  minor fix to score for weak back rank.  score   *
*           was in units of 'defects' but should have been in units of        *
*           "centipawns".   minor bug in "drawn.c" could mis-classify some    *
*           positions as drawn when they were not.                            *
*                                                                             *
*   17.7    repair to DrawScore() logic to stop the occasional backward sign  *
*           that could create some funny-looking scores (-20 and +20 for      *
*           example).  minor fix to majority code to recognize the advantage  *
*           of having a majority when the opponent has no passers or majority *
*           even if the candidate in the majority is not an 'outside' passer  *
*           candidate.  minor change to passed pawns so that a protected      *
*           passed pawn is not considered a winning advantage if the          *
*           opponent has two or more passed pawns.  but in input_status       *
*           would cause an infinite loop if you reset a game to a position    *
*           that was in book, after searching a position that was not in      *
*           the book.  bug in position learning fixed also.  this was caused  *
*           by the new hashing scheme Tim Mann introduced to avoid locking    *
*           the hash table.  I completed the changes he suggested, but forgot *
*           about how it might affect the position learning since it is also  *
*           hash-based.  needless to say, I broke it quite nicely, thank you. *
*                                                                             *
*   17.8    this is the version used in the first ICC computer chess          *
*           tournament.  Crafty won with a score of 7.0/8.0 which included    *
*           only 2 draws and no losses.  changes are minimal except for a few *
*           non-engine syntax changes to eliminate warnings and fix a bad bug *
*           in 'bench.c' that would crash if there was no books.bin file.     *
*                                                                             *
*   17.9    LearnPosition() called with wrong arguments from main() which     *
*           effectively disabled position learning.  this was broken in 17.7  *
*           but is now fixed.                                                 *
*                                                                             *
*   17.10   minor change to "threat" extension now only extends if the null-  *
*           move search returns "mated in 1" and not "mated in N".  this      *
*           tends to shrink the trees a bit with no noticable effect in       *
*           tactical strength.  EvaluatePawns() was not doing a reasonable    *
*           job of recognizing blocked pawns and candidate passers.  it did   *
*           not do well in recognizing that the pawn supporting a candidate   *
*           could not advance far enough to help make a real passed pawn.     *
*           minor change to RepetitionCheck() to not count two-fold repeats   *
*           as draws in the first two plies, which prevents some odd-looking  *
*           repeats at the expense of a little inefficiency.  Ugly repetition *
*           bug fixed.  rephead was off by one for whatever side crafty was   *
*           playing which would screw up repetition detection in some cases.  *
*           minor bug in main() that would report stalemate on some mates     *
*           when the ponder score was forgotten.                              *
*                                                                             *
*   17.11   Fail high/low logic changed to move the ++ output into Iterate()  *
*           where the -- output was already located.  (This was done for      *
*           consistecy only, it was not a problem.  New function to detect    *
*           draws RepetitionCheckBook() was added to count two-fold repeats   *
*           as draws while in book.  This lets Crafty search to see if it     *
*           wants tht draw or not, rather than just repeating blindly.  Minor *
*           bug in "go"/"move" command fixed.  The command did not work if    *
*           the engine was pondering.  minor change to Evaluate() that makes  *
*           BAD_TRADE code more acurate.  minor change to pawn majority code  *
*           to fix two bugs.  white pawns on g2/h2 with black pawn on h7 was  *
*           not seen as a majority (outside candidate passer) but moving the  *
*           black pawn to g7 made it work fine.   Also if both sides had an   *
*           equal number of pawns (black pawn at a7/b7, white pawns at b2/c2  *
*           the code would not notice black had an outside passer candidate   *
*           since pawns were 'equal' in number.                               *
*                                                                             *
*   17.12   BookUp() will now create a book with all sorts of games in it, so *
*           long as the various games have the FEN string to properly set the *
*           initial chess board position.                                     *
*                                                                             *
*   17.13   endgame evaluation problem fixed.  king scoring now dynamically   *
*           chooses the right piece/square table depending on which side of   *
*           the board has pawns, rather than using root pre-processing which  *
*           could make some gross errors.  glitch with majorities would make  *
*           an "inside majority candidate" offset a real outside passed pawn  *
*           even if the candidate would not be outside.  a suggestion by      *
*           Blass Uri (CCC) was added.  this adds .01 to tablebase scores if  *
*           the side on move is ahead in material, and -.01 if the side on    *
*           move is behind in material (only for drawn positions.)  the       *
*           intent is to favor positions where you are ahead in material      *
*           rather than even in material, which gives 'swindle mode' a chance *
*           to work.  bug in EvaluateDraws() would mis-categorize some B+RP   *
*           (wrong bishop) as drawn, even if the losing king could not make   *
*           it to the corner square in time.                                  *
*                                                                             *
*   17.14   another endgame evaluation problem fixed.  the outside passed     *
*           pawn code worked well, up until the point the pawn had to be      *
*           given up to decoy the other side's king away from the remainder   *
*           of the pawns.  Crafty now understands the king being closer to    *
*           the pawns than the enemy king, and therefore transitions from     *
*           outside passer to won king-pawn ending much cleaner.  new command *
*           "selective" as requested by S. Lim, which allows the user to      *
*           set the min/max null move R values (default=2/3).  they can be    *
*           set to 0 which disables null-move totally, or they can be set     *
*           larger than the default for testing.  minor changes to init.c     *
*           sent by Eugene Nalimov to handle 64 bit pointer declarations for  *
*           win64 executable compilation.  NetBSD changes included along with *
*           a new Makefile that requires no editing to use for any known      *
*           configuration ("make help" will explain how to use it).  this was *
*           submitted by Johnny Lam.  serious changes to the outside passed   *
*           pawn code.  the evaluator now understands that outside passers    *
*           on _both_ sides of the board is basically winning.  same goes for *
*           candidate passers.                                                *
*                                                                             *
