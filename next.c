 *   NextRootMove() is used to select the next move from the root move list.   *

 *   There is one subtle trick here that must not be broken.  Crafty does LMR  *
 *   at the root, and the reduction amount is dependent on the order in which  *
 *   a specific move is searched.  With the recent changes dealing with this   *
 *   issue in non-root moves, NextRootMove() now simply returns the move's     *
 *   order within the move list.  This might be a problem if the last move in  *
 *   the list fails high, because it would be reduced on the re-search, which  *
 *   is something we definitely don't want.  The solution is found in the code *
 *   inside Iterate().  When a move fails high, it is moved to the top of the  *
 *   move list so that (a) it is searched first on the re-search (more on this *
 *   in a moment) and (b) since its position in the move list is now #1, it    *
 *   will get an order value of 1 which is never reduced.  The only warning is *
 *   that Iterate() MUST re-sort the ply-1 move list after a fail high, even   *
 *   though it seems like a very tiny computational waste.                     *
 *                                                                             *
 *   The other reason for doing the re-sort has to do with the parallel search *
 *   algorithm.  When one thread fails high at the root, it stops the others.  *
 *   they have to carefully undo the "this move has been searched" flag since  *
 *   these incomplete searches need to be re-done after the fail-high move is  *
 *   finished.  But it is possible some of those interrupted moves appear      *
 *   before the fail high move in the move list.  Which would lead Crafty to   *
 *   fail high, then produce a different best move's PV.  By re-sorting, now   *
 *   the fail-high move is always searched first since here we just start at   *
 *   the top of the move list and look for the first "not yet searched" move   *
 *   to return.  It solves several problems, but if that re-sort is not done,  *
 *   things go south quickly.  The voice of experience is all I will say here. *
 *                                                                             *
