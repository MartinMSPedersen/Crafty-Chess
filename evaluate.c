 *   Evaluate() is used to evaluate the chess board.  Broadly, it addresses    *
 *   four (4) distinct areas:  (1) material score which is simply a summing of *
 *   piece types multiplied by piece values;  (2) pawn scoring which considers *
 *   placement of pawns and also evaluates passed pawns, particularly in end-  *
 *   game situations;  (3) piece scoring which evaluates the placement of each *
 *   piece as well as things like piece mobility;  (4) king safety which       *
 *   considers the pawn shelter around the king and enemy pieces and how close *
 *   they are to assist in a king-side attack.                                 *
 *                                                                             *

 *   EvaluatePassedPawnRaces() is used to evaluate passed pawns when one       *
 *   side has passed pawns and the other side (or neither) has pieces.  In     *

 *   pawn from queening or is it too far away?  If only one side has pawns     *
 *   that can "run" then the situation is simple.  When both sides have pawns  *
 *   that can "run" it becomes more complex as it then becomes necessary to    *
 *   see if one side can use a forced king move to stop the other side, while  *
 *   the other side doesn't have the same ability to stop ours.                *

 *   In the case of king and pawn endings with exactly one pawn, the simple    *
 *   evaluation rules are used:  if the king is two squares in front of the    *
 *   pawn then it is a win, if the king is one one square in front with the    *
 *   opposition, then it is a win,  if the king is on the 6th rank with the    *
 *   pawn close by, it is a win.  Rook pawns are handled separately and are    *
 *   more difficult to queen because the king can get trapped in front of the  *
 *   pawn blocking promotion.                                                  *

 *   EvaluatePawns() is used to evaluate pawns.  It evaluates pawns for only   *
 *   one side, and fills in the pawn hash entry information.  It requires two  *
 *   calls to evaluate all pawns on the board.  Comments below indicate the    *
 *   particular pawn structure features that are evaluated.                    *
 *                                                                             *
 *   This procedure also flags which pawns are passed, since this is scored in *
 *   another part of the evaluation because that includes piece information    *
 *   which can not be used here since the pawn hash signature does not include *
 *   piece information of any kind.                                            *

 *   Note that a pawn is not penalized for two different reasons.  If it is    *
 *   isolated, it is not backward.  Etc.  This simplifies evaluation tuning    *
 *   not to mention eliminating the overlap and interaction that was happening *
 *   previously when multiple penalties could be applied.                      *
