 *   Evaluate() is used to evaluate the chess board.  broadly, it addresses    *
 *   four (4) distinct areas:  (1) material score which is simply a summing of *
 *   piece types multiplied by piece values;  (2) pawn scoring which considers *
 *   placement of pawns and also evaluates passed pawns, particularly in end-  *
 *   game situations;  (3) piece scoring which evaluates the placement of each *
 *   piece as well as things like piece mobility;  (4) king safety which       *
 *   considers the pawn shelter around the king along with material present to *
 *   facilitate an attack.                                                     *

 *   attacks the opposing side's queening square.  for the special case of a   *
