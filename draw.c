*   DrawScore() is used to determine how good or bad a draw is in the current  *
*   game situation.  It depends on several factors, including the stage of the *
*   game (opening [draw=bad], middlegame [draw=somewhat bad] and endgames      *
*   [draw=default_draw_score.])  Additionally, it looks at the opponent's time *
*   remaining in the game, and if it's low, it will eschew the draw and press  *
*   the opponent to win before his flag falls.                                 *
*                                                                              *
