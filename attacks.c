 *   AttacksTo() is used to produce a bitboard which is a map of all squares   *
 *   that directly attack this <square>.  The non-sliding pieces are trivial   *
 *   to detect, but for sliding pieces, we use a bitboard trick.  The idea is  *
 *   to compute the squares a queen would attack, if it was standing on        *
 *   <square> and then look at the last square attacked in each direction to   *
 *   determine if it is a sliding piece that moves in the right direction.  To *
 *   finish up, we simply need to Or() all these attackers together.           *
 *                                                                             *
